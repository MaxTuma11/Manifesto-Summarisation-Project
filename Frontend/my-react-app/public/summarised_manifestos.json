          "crime": "The Green Party’s policies on crime and policing, outlined in the manifesto section titled \"Bringing Justice to Crime and Policing,\" focus on transforming the justice system through prevention, community-based policing, and restorative justice, rather than relying solely on punitive measures like imprisonment. The party asserts that everyone has the right to feel safe, whether on the street, at home, or online, and that structural injustice must be tackled. Here is a summary of the Green Party’s policies on crime and justice: 1. Policing and Building Trust The party emphasizes that policing must operate by consent, which necessitates restoring trust with the communities served. • Tackling Institutional Prejudice: Police Services need to acknowledge and root out institutional racism, misogyny, homophobia, and disablism that have long dominated policing. • Accountability: Police Services should be accountable to elected local government and the communities where they work. • Stop and Search/Facial Recognition: Elected Greens will push for an end to the routine use of stop and search and an end to the use of facial recognition software. The use of traumatizing tactics like stop and search should become an exception, not routine. • Staff Training: Police Services must deliver ongoing fitness to practice assessments on diversity for all police officers and relevant civilian staff. • Youth Encounters: Safeguarding is the priority in encounters between young people and the police. The party advocates for youth workers, rather than police officers, to work with pupils in schools. Children and young people should never be strip-searched without an appropriate adult present, and only in very exceptional circumstances. 2. Restorative Justice and Sentencing Reform The Green approach is grounded in a belief that rehabilitation is the best way to reduce future offending. • Restorative Justice: The party will expand restorative justice when crimes occur to give victims a voice and help offenders take responsibility for the harm they have caused. • Presumption Against Short Sentences: The party would seek to break the cycle of reoffending by legislating for a presumption against custodial sentences under two years. Evidence shows that short prison sentences are especially ineffective and lead to higher rates of recidivism. • Focus on Prevention: They will focus on crime prevention by restoring funding withdrawn from youth services since 2010 and investing in community-based policing. 3. Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) Ending domestic abuse and violence against women and girls is listed as a Green Party priority. • Hate Crime: Elected Greens will push to make misogyny a hate crime across the UK. • Strategy and Training: They will develop and implement a new UK-wide strategy to tackle gender-based violence (including domestic violence, rape, sexual abuse, FGM, and trafficking). They will also ensure that domestic abuse and gender-based violence is a key measurable priority for all police forces, and that all police officers are trained to recognize and tackle domestic violence. • Funding Services: Local authorities must be funded so that domestic violence, rape crisis, and other support provision can meet local needs. • Sex Work: Elected Greens will push to decriminalise sex work. 4. Court System and Funding The manifesto addresses the \"chaos\" in the court system that currently lets down victims and the accused. • Investment: The party will invest £11 billion in restoring the Ministry of Justice budget over the course of the next parliament. • Court Repairs: They commit to repairing and renewing the court system with a £2.5 billion investment. • Legal Aid and Bar Funding: The investment would be used to restore legal aid budgets and ensure the Criminal Bar is sufficiently well funded. • Recruitment: They will push to recruit more judges and ensure they are representative of wider society. • Tackling Backlogs: Investment is needed in the criminal justice system so that defendants are brought to trial quickly in the interests of both the victim and the accused. 5. Drug Law Reform The party supports an evidence-based approach to drug law reform, arguing that current laws are counterproductive. • National Commission: Push for the establishment of a National Commission to agree on an evidence-based approach to reforming the UK’s drug laws. • Decriminalisation: Elected Greens will push to decriminalise personal possession of drugs. This is intended to divert people from the criminal justice system toward support for addiction, housing, and employment, thereby freeing up hundreds of thousands of hours of police time. • Diversion: They will ensure that diversion programs are in place for all low-level drug and alcohol-related offenses and for young offenders arrested for low-level offenses. This aims to move towards a legally regulated market that stops criminal supply and profiteering and reduces harm. 6. Public Health Approach to Violence The Green Party supports using a public health approach to reducing violence, drawing on evidence that this is compelling. • Violence Reduction Units (VRUs): They support the use of VRUs and the need for them to focus on multi-agency working, similar to the model that helped decrease violence in Scotland. • Local Control: They will push for more local control over public services to ensure effective joined-up working across public services to deliver violence reduction strategies. 7. Protecting Civil Rights The manifesto includes a commitment to scrap recent legislation that erodes rights and protest: • Scrapping Legislation: Elected Greens will push to scrap the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, the Public Order Act, and other legislation that erodes the right to protest and to free expression. • Legal Aid: They will restore legal aid for public law cases so everybody can uphold their rights in court.",
          "healthcare": "The Green Party’s manifesto, titled \"Real Hope. Real Change. Manifesto for a Fairer, Greener Country,\" dedicates a significant section to Building a Fairer, Healthier Country and Caring with Fairness, Compassion and Dignity, committing to defend the NHS against privatization and fix the social care crisis. The party asserts that the NHS is currently facing the most serious crisis in its 80-year history due to deliberate Conservative under-funding and the risk of collapse, which paves the way for privatization. Greens are committed to a fully public health service and keeping the profit motive away from the NHS. Here is a summary of the key healthcare and related policies: 1. NHS Funding, Access, and Privatization The party proposes significant financial commitments to stabilize and expand the National Health Service (NHS). • Increased Funding: The NHS in England would receive additional annual expenditure of £8 billion in the first full year of the next parliament, rising to a total of £28 billion by 2030. • Capital Spending: An additional capital spending of at least £20 billion is needed in total over the next five years, including £12 billion for hospital building and repair. • Waiting Lists and Access: Elected Greens will push for a steady reduction in waiting lists. They would guarantee rapid access to a GP and same-day access in case of urgent need. • Anti-Privatization: Green MPs will back the NHS Reinstatement Bill to abolish wasteful competition within the NHS, re-establish public bodies and public accountability, and restrict the role of commercial companies. They will always stand against the marketisation and privatization of the NHS. 2. NHS Staff and Pay Tackling staff retention and low pay is a priority to address the crisis in the health service. • Fair Pay: The party would choose to treat and pay nurses, doctors, and NHS staff fairly, specifically to avoid losing them overseas. They will prioritize supporting NHS workers, including providing an immediate one-off budget increase to cover fair wage settlements. • Junior Doctors: Elected Greens will support the junior doctors’ call for pay restoration. • Valuing Professionals: NHS professionals should be valued with pay and conditions that reflect their essential skills and dedication. 3. Primary Care and Public Health The manifesto emphasizes investment in prevention and early diagnosis, arguing that this improves quality of life and reduces demand on the wider NHS. • Primary Care Investment: Funding allocated to primary medical care will be increased, with additional annual spending reaching £1.5 billion by 2030, targeted at areas of greatest need. • GP Support: Measures include reducing the administrative burden on GPs, for example, by allowing hospital doctors to make onward referrals without needing to go back to a patient’s GP. • Diagnostic Capacity: There would be expansion of diagnostic capacity in communities to ensure early diagnosis and better outcomes. • Restoring Public Health Budgets: Public health budgets would be restored to 2015/16 levels with an immediate increase of £1.5 billion. This money would properly fund services like smoking cessation, drug and alcohol treatment, and sexual health services. • Cross-Government Approach: Health would be a cross-government priority, supported by interventions across the manifesto such as improved food labelling, free school meals, active travel, and investment in sport. 4. NHS Dentistry The failure to properly fund NHS dentistry has led to scandals like patients pulling out their own teeth. • Guaranteed Access: The party commits to guaranteed access to an NHS dentist for everybody. • Investment: Additional investment in NHS dentistry is proposed, reaching £3 billion a year by 2030. • Children’s Dental Care: Campaign for funding for community hubs and primary care to provide a roll-out of free dental nursing for children and those on low incomes, focusing on preventative work. 5. Social Care and Welfare Greens believe that health and care services go hand in hand and propose significant investment to address the crisis in social care, which currently includes over 400,000 people awaiting care. • Free Personal Care: Introduce Free Personal Care to ensure dignity in old age and for disabled people, based on the Scottish Government’s approach. This includes fully funding personal care elements for those in residential settings. • Social Care Investment: Commit to investing £20 billion per year into the social care system. • Carer Support: Establish a career structure for carers, including national pay, terms, and conditions, increased pay rates, and a pathway to progression with training and qualifications. The party would also change the working visa system to end the exploitation of overseas workers in the care sector. • Gloria’s Law: Campaign for \"Gloria’s Law,\" which gives everybody the right to at least one essential Care Supporter (relative or friend) when using health or care services. 6. Mental Health and Specialized Care The manifesto aims to achieve true equality between mental and physical health care. • Access to Therapy: Ensure that everyone who needs evidence-based mental health therapies can access them within 28 days. • Targeted Provision: Guarantee tailored and specific mental health provision for communities of color, children and adolescents, older people, and LGBTIQA+ communities. • School Counsellors: Provide a trained and paid counsellor in every primary and secondary school and every sixth-form college. • National Cancer Plan: Commit to a National Cancer Control Plan focused on reducing cases through public health interventions, meeting the target of 75% of cases diagnosed early (Stage 1 or 2) by 2028, and delivering treatment through publicly funded research. • HIV Prevention: Work towards ending new HIV transmissions by 2030 using proven actions, including access to the HIV prevention pill (PrEP) and renewing opt-out HIV testing programs in A&Es in high-prevalence areas. 7. Disability Rights and Other Health Measures The party commits to restoring the dignity and rights of disabled people. • Benefits Uplift: Restore the value of disability benefits with an immediate uplift of 5%. • PIP Reform: Oppose plans to replace Personal Independence Payments (PIP) cash payments with \"vouchers,\" and reform intrusive eligibility tests in the long term. • Assisted Dying: Back changing the law on assisted dying, supporting a humane and dignified approach for the terminally ill, provided proper safeguards are in place. • Drug Laws: Push for a National Commission to agree on an evidence-based approach to reform counterproductive drug laws, aiming to move toward a legally regulated market that reduces harm. The Green Party views this comprehensive investment package as essential to lifting everyone up and ensuring that all citizens have access to the extra support and safety net they need throughout their lives.",
          "housing": "The Green Party’s housing policies, detailed in the manifesto section titled \"Providing Fairer, Greener Homes for All,\" aim to fundamentally change the view of housing from being merely an asset to ensuring everyone has a safe, warm, and affordable home. The policies prioritize the provision of genuinely affordable social housing, comprehensive insulation, and robust renters’ rights. Here is a summary of the key housing and homes policies: 1. Social Housing and Affordability The manifesto attributes the national housing crisis to forty years of treating houses as assets and neglecting social housing construction, noting that over 130,000 children are currently growing up in temporary accommodation. • Social Home Provision: Elected Greens will push to provide 150,000 new social homes a year. • End \"Right to Buy\": They will end the so-called \"right to buy\" to ensure that newly built social homes continue to belong to communities and remain available for those who need a secure, warm home. • Maintenance of Stock: Green MPs will push Ministers to ensure all social housing stock is brought up to and kept at a decent standard, with fair funding for Councils and Housing Associations to achieve this. • Empty Homes: Local authorities would be empowered to bring empty homes (estimated at around a million across the UK) back into use. • Buy the Supply: Legislation would be introduced to give local authorities, registered social landlords, and community housing groups the first option to buy certain properties at reasonable rates, such as private rental property that is left empty for over six months or fails to meet the decent homes standard or EPC C rating. 2. Fairer, Greener Homes Guarantee and Retrofit The manifesto introduces a Fairer, Greener Homes Guarantee to tackle fuel poverty and high energy bills caused by the UK having \"the worst insulated homes in Europe\". The cheapest energy bill, the manifesto states, is the one you don’t have to pay. • Retrofitting Investment: Elected Greens will invest £29 billion over the next five years to insulate homes to EPC B standard or above, as part of a ten-year program. ◦ This includes £12 billion to retrofit social housing stock and £17 billion in grants to retrofit privately owned homes. • Heating Systems: They will invest £9 billion over five years for heating systems (e.g., heat pumps) for homes and other buildings. • Climate Adaptation: A further £7 billion over five years will be invested to adapt homes to avoid over-heating in hotter summers. • Delivery Model: The party will introduce a local-authority-led, street-by-street or area-based retrofit programme to install non-fossil-fuel heat and adapt buildings to more extreme weather. • Financing: The program will be financed by ensuring that: ◦ Competitive bidding for the social housing decarbonisation fund ends. ◦ Homeowners can easily access property-linked finance. ◦ Private tenants have the right to insist their landlords access property-linked finance, with rent controls preventing the costs from being passed directly to tenants. 3. Planning and New Building Standards The party aims to transform the planning system to protect green spaces, reduce environmental impact, and support flourishing communities. • New Building Standards: Elected Greens will campaign to change building regulations so all new homes must meet Passivhaus or equivalent standards. New homes must also include solar panels and low-carbon heating systems such as heat pumps. • Infrastructure Support: Large-scale developments must be supported by new infrastructure, including GP surgeries, bus services, cycling and walking networks, and extra places at nurseries and schools, so residents do not have to rely on cars. • Green Space Protection: They are committed to protecting the Green Belt and ensuring everybody has easy access to a green space. • Construction Emissions: To lower carbon emissions from the built environment, they will require: ◦ Demolition to require a full planning application. ◦ All planning applications to include whole-life carbon and energy calculations. ◦ Increasing disposal rates for builders’ waste to incentivize material reuse. • Public Accountability: They will take back the power of building control from developers and invest in publicly accountable building inspectors to prevent the continued provision of dangerous and substandard homes. 4. Renters’ Rights The manifesto outlines policies to protect the rights of the millions of people who rent their homes. • Rent Controls: Elected Greens will empower local authorities to introduce rent controls if the local rental market is overheated, while allowing for maintenance. • Ending No-Fault Evictions: They will push to end no-fault evictions (Section 21) and introduce long-term leases to ensure private tenants are secure in their homes. • Efficiency Improvements: Renters will be given a new right to demand energy efficiency improvements from their landlords. • Dispute Resolution: Private Residential Tenancy Boards would be introduced to provide an informal, cheap, and speedy forum for resolving disputes before they reach a tribunal. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Green Party’s housing strategy is designed to address the housing crisis by making homes more affordable through massive social building and empowering people to live in warmer, greener, and safer homes through mandatory high standards and deep retrofitting investment.",
          "immigration": "The Green Party’s manifesto outlines immigration policies focused on adopting an \"outward-looking approach\", welcoming contributions from migrants and refugees, and ending the current punitive system. The party believes the UK has a collective responsibility regarding the climate emergency and a duty to support individuals displaced by changes in their home environments. Elected Greens will prioritize the following: Ending the Hostile Environment and Cruelty The core of the policy is dismantling the \"hostile environment\" approach, which has caused \"immense suffering,\" including to the Windrush generation. • Abolish \"No Recourse to Public Funds\": Campaign to abolish the No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) condition, which currently exacerbates social, economic, and racial inequalities. • Abolish the Ten-Year Settlement Route: Campaign to abolish the ten-year route to settlement, which is seen as unfairly trapping people in poverty and hardship. • End Immigration Detention: Migration is viewed as \"not a criminal offence under any circumstances\". The party would end immigration detention for all migrants unless they pose a danger to public safety. • Free NHS Access: Access to the NHS should be free and comprehensive for migrants with visas. Asylum and Sanctuary The Green Party acknowledges the right to claim asylum as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. • Safe Routes to Sanctuary: Push for the UK to collaborate with other countries to establish safe routes for those fleeing danger, persecution, war, or climate disaster. This allows people to arrive safely and make their case without risking their lives. • Fast and Fair Process: Advocate for a system of asylum and humanitarian protection that treats applicants fairly, humanely, and without discrimination. • Right to Work: Those seeking asylum and protection must be permitted to work while their application is being decided. • Climate Migration: Recognize that as the climate crisis worsens, more people may be forced to leave their homes. The party’s proposed significant increase in the overseas aid budget and support for lower-income countries is intended to help people stay in their communities, but policies will also ensure those forced to leave can do so safely and with dignity. System Reform and Visa Requirements The manifesto calls for structural reforms within the government and changes to visa rules affecting workers and families. • Dismantle the Home Office: Push to dismantle the dysfunctional Home Office and create a new Department of Migration alongside a separate Department of Justice. This separates functions around migration and citizenship from the criminal justice system. • Simplified Visa System: The system of visa applications should be simplified and processed swiftly, with empathy and intelligence. • Application Fees: Seek to end the exploitation of people for profit by only charging application fees at cost. • Family and Spousal Visas: Elected Greens will push to remove minimum income requirements from all applications, including spousal visas, so that all British citizens have the right to reside with their loved ones regardless of their income. • Family Reunification: Migrants, including students, should be allowed to bring family members to the UK who would normally live with them in their country of origin. • Voting Rights: All visa-holding residents should have the right to vote in all elections and referendums. The party emphasizes that they welcome the economic and societal contributions that immigrants and refugees make to British society and want to support migrants in putting down roots.",
          "defence": "The Green Party’s policies on defense are primarily framed within the context of global peace, international law, disarmament, and reforming existing security alliances. The party believes the UK’s foreign policy should be based on shared commitments to democracy, peace, global solidarity, and the protection of human rights in an increasingly volatile world. Here is a summary of the Green Party’s policies on security and defense: 1. Nuclear Disarmament The most decisive defense policy proposed is the immediate dismantling of the UK’s nuclear arsenal. • Signing the TPNW: Elected Greens will push for the UK to sign the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). • Dismantling Trident: Following the signing of the TPNW, the party would immediately begin the process of dismantling the UK’s nuclear weapons, cancelling the Trident programme, and removing all foreign nuclear weapons from UK soil. • International Efforts: They would work with international partners to enlarge TPNW membership and ensure all states meet their commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. • Savings: The cancellation of the Trident replacement is included in the manifesto’s statistical appendix as a source of savings. 2. NATO and Security Architecture Reform While recognizing the role of mutual defense alliances, the Green Party seeks significant reform within NATO. • NATO Role: The party recognizes that NATO has an important role in ensuring member states can respond to security threats and supports the principle of international solidarity through mutual defence alliances and multilateral security frameworks. • Reform Focus: They will work within NATO for a greater focus on outreach and dialogue to support global peacebuilding, based on democratic and inclusive values. • Specific Reforms: Crucial reforms to the way NATO operates that they seek include: ◦ A commitment to a \"No First Use\" of nuclear weapons. ◦ Ensuring that diplomacy and practical co-operation always take precedence over military action. ◦ Mandating that NATO must act solely in defence of member states. • European Security: They will also work towards reform of the European security architecture and disarmament, based on shared commitments to democracy and mutual transparency. 3. International Law and Conflict The party prioritizes the rule of law, including international law, which underpins rights and protects against state aggression and genocide. • International Law Enforcement: They want the UK to take the lead in upholding the right to self-determination and the enforcement of international law. • Support for Ukraine: They commit to continuing to support Ukraine as it resists Russian invasion. • Israel and Palestine: The party calls for an immediate and permanent bilateral ceasefire. They support the return of hostages and the recognition of the state of Palestine. They also push for an end to all UK arms exports to and military cooperation with Israel, arguing this makes the British government complicit in war crimes. They support the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and believe there is strong evidence supporting the submission to the International Court of Justice regarding Israel’s conduct in Gaza. 4. Other Related Policies • Military Animal Testing: They would end the use of live animals in military training. • Global Solidarity: In a world threatened by climate-driven instability, mass migration, and war, they stress the need for enlightened leadership and international solidarity.",
          "economy": "The economic policies outlined in the Green Party’s 2024 General Election Manifesto, \"Real Hope. Real Change. Manifesto for a Fairer, Greener Country,\" center on a green economic transformation funded primarily by taxing wealth and pollution, and bringing privatized utilities into public ownership. The manifesto argues that the solutions to the climate crisis align with those needed to end the cost of living and inequality crises, leading to a decarbonized economy with cheaper costs for heating, travel, and business operation. Here is a summary of the key economic policies and funding mechanisms: 1. Green Economic Transformation and Public Investment The Green Party commits to a significant, large-scale, long-term program of investment in a green economic transformation, alongside the private sector. • Investment Commitment: The plan requires an average investment of £40 billion per year over the course of the next parliament. • Climate Adaptation: This investment includes £7 billion annually on climate adaptation. • Investment Breakdown: The required spending (totaling £161 billion over the parliament, based on the statistical appendix) includes: ◦ £50 billion for electricity generation, transmission, and storage. ◦ £50 billion for retrofitting buildings, installing non-fossil fuel heating systems, and adapting homes for a climate-changed world. ◦ £30 billion for investing in a modern, electrified railway. ◦ £12 billion for water and sewage infrastructure. ◦ £30 billion allocated for the nationalization of water companies and the Big 5 retail energy companies. • Borrowing Strategy: The party rejects the \"self-imposed straitjacket of conventional fiscal rules\" and is prepared to borrow to invest. The overarching fiscal rule would be that public expenditure is only expanded as far as the economy has the capacity to absorb it without triggering dangerous levels of inflation. • Research and Development (R&D): Green MPs will seek to increase R&D investment by over £30 billion across the five-year parliament, focusing on areas tackling the climate and environmental crisis, such as energy storage, agroecological agriculture, and carbon-neutral construction. 2. Tax Reforms and Revenue Generation The manifesto proposes tax reforms designed to generate substantial revenue, estimated to raise between £50 billion and £70 billion per year by the end of the next parliament. These revenues are intended to rescue public services and fund climate protection. • Wealth Tax: A wealth tax would be introduced on the wealth of individual taxpayers. This would levy: ◦ 1% annually on assets above £10 million. ◦ 2% annually on assets above £1 billion. • Capital Gains Tax (CGT): Elected Greens would reform CGT by aligning the rates paid on taxable gains with the rates paid on income. • Investment Income: Tax rates on investment income would be reformed by aligning them with the tax and NIC rates on employment income. • National Insurance: The party would remove the Upper Earnings Limit that restricts the amount of National Insurance paid by high earners. • Carbon Tax: A carbon tax would be introduced on all fossil fuels (domestic or imported) to make polluters pay and incentivize decarbonization. ◦ The tax would start at an initial rate of £120 per tonne. ◦ It would progressively rise to a maximum of £500 per tonne of carbon emitted within ten years. ◦ This measure is estimated to raise up to an additional £80 billion by the end of the parliament before falling back as emissions reduce. • Windfall Taxes: Green MPs would support an increase in the rate of the windfall tax on oil and gas production, closing existing loopholes. They would also introduce a windfall tax on banks when excessive profits are being made. • Property Taxes: In the long term, the party aims for a Land Value Tax. In the next parliament, steps would include re-evaluation of Council Tax bands and the removal of business rate relief on various properties. • VAT Changes: Proposed changes include reducing VAT on hospitality and the arts, and increasing it on financial services and private education. 3. Public Ownership and Financial Regulation The manifesto seeks to reverse the failure of privatization by bringing key utilities back into public hands, arguing that the government can borrow and invest more cheaply than private companies. • Immediate Public Ownership: Commit to immediately bringing the railways, the water companies, and the Big 5 retail energy companies back into public ownership. • Financial Services Regulation: Green MPs would mandate companies holding a UK banking licence to present a strategy for divestment of current fossil fuel assets by 2030. • Bank of England Mandate: The Bank of England’s mandate would be changed to make funding the sustainability transition a central objective, alongside price stability. • Non-bank Institutions: UK pension funds, investment funds, and insurance companies would be required to remove fossil fuel assets from their portfolios and balance sheets by 2030. • Regional Mutual Banks: The party will back the creation of regional mutual banks, capitalized with a Co-operative Development Fund and an additional £10 billion of public money, to drive investment in decarbonization, SMEs, and community-owned enterprises. 4. Labor and Welfare Policies The economic platform includes substantial increases to the minimum wage and welfare benefits, funded by the proposed tax increases. • Minimum Wage: Introduce a minimum wage of £15 an hour for all, regardless of age, with costs offset for small businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance to £10,000. • Pay Ratios: Campaign for a maximum 10:1 pay ratio for all private and public-sector organizations. • Universal Credit (UC): Increase UC and legacy benefits by £40 a week. • Welfare Reform: Abolish the two-child benefit cap, end benefit sanctions, and scrap the bedroom tax. • Universal Basic Income (UBI): Push for the long-term introduction of a Universal Basic Income. Analogy The Green Party’s economic approach is akin to renovating an old, inefficient house (the UK economy). They propose securing the necessary funds by having the wealthiest occupants and polluters pay their fair share (Wealth Tax and Carbon Tax), and then using that capital to invest heavily in modern, efficient, and collectively owned infrastructure (renewables, public transport, and retrofitting). This comprehensive investment is intended not just to stop the leaks and damage (climate crisis), but to create a warmer, safer, and fairer structure for everyone who lives there (a fairer, greener country).",
          "education": "The Green Party’s manifesto outlines policies aimed at transforming the education system to prioritize the love of learning, inclusivity, and lifelong support, while ensuring every child can reach their potential. The party views education as a common good that should be publicly funded and available free of charge at every stage of life. Here is a summary of the Green Party’s education policies: 1. Schools and Funding The manifesto addresses the negative impacts of over a decade of funding cuts, assessment targets, and a teacher recruitment crisis. • Increased School Funding: Elected Greens will advocate for an increase in school funding, with an £8 billion investment in schools, which includes £2 billion for a pay uplift for teachers. • School Buildings: They plan to ensure every school building is safe by investing £2.5 billion a year to tackle issues like the RAAC concrete scandal, and provide necessary funding for schools to be well-maintained and fit for purpose. • Curriculum and Assessment: They will review assessment targets so that arts and vocational subjects are treated equally within the curriculum. The party will also end high-stakes, formal testing at primary and secondary schools and abolish OFSTED to reduce stress in the education system. • Green Curriculum: Children should be supported to learn outdoors and learn about the climate and biodiversity crisis to prepare them for future challenges. They will ensure effective delivery of the new Natural History GCSE. • Privatization and Fees: Elected Greens would move academies and free schools into local authority control. They would remove charitable status from private schools and charge full VAT on fees, though private school places for children with special education needs would not be subject to VAT as an interim measure until public-sector capacity is built. 2. Special Educational Needs (SEND) and Child Wellbeing The party commits to ensuring adequate support for neurodivergent children and those with special needs. • SEND Investment: They will push for £5 billion to be invested in special needs (SEND) provision within mainstream schools. This funding aims to ensure all schools have fully accessible buildings and specially trained teachers. • Transport: They will make it mandatory for councils to provide free transport for 16–18-year-old pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disability. • Counselling and Medical Staff: They will provide a trained and paid counsellor in every primary and secondary school, and every sixth-form college. This will be supported through bursaries to train counsellors from underrepresented backgrounds. They will also fully restore the role of the school nurse, ensuring all schools have access to an on-site medical professional. 3. Early Years and Food Education policies begin at the earliest stages, with a focus on play and support. • Early Years: Pre-school education should be focused on play and supporting young children to safely explore the world. • Sure Start: They will advocate for £1.4 billion per year to be invested by local authorities in Sure Start Centres. • Childcare: In negotiation with the sector, they will seek to extend the outgoing government’s offer of childcare to 35 hours per week from nine months. • Free School Meals: They will ensure all children have a daily free school meal (made from nutritious ingredients and sustainable produce). They will also protect provision of free school breakfast clubs for all primary school pupils up to Year 6. • Food Education: Schools should involve children in growing, preparing, and cooking food as part of the core curriculum. 4. Post-16 and Higher Education The party aims to make education and training accessible for lifelong learning. • Further Education (FE): They will push for a £3 billion increase in funding for sixth-form education over the next parliamentary term, and a £12 billion investment in skills and lifelong learning for further education. • Financial Support (Post-16): They propose the restoration of the Education Maintenance Allowance to financially support young people to continue their studies after age 16. • Higher Education Funding: They would fully fund every higher education student, restoring maintenance grants and scrapping undergraduate tuition fees. Their long-term plans also include seeking to cancel graduate debt. • Teacher Pensions: Elected Greens will work with the higher education sector to address challenges posed by changes to employer contributions for the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS). 5. Other Policies • Relationships, Sex and Health Education: They will retain a full, evidence-based, and age-appropriate programme of Relationships, Sex and Health Education, including LGBTIQA+ content and resources. • Sports Facilities: They support allowing access to school sports facilities by local clubs and teams outside teaching hours to ensure maximum use of a valuable resource. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Note: The sources indicate that education policy in Wales is devolved to the Welsh Government, and the Scottish Green Party is distinct, meaning these summaries primarily reflect policy intentions for England or the UK where powers are reserved).",
          "environment": "The Green Party’s environmental policies, central to their manifesto \"Real Hope. Real Change. Manifesto for a Fairer, Greener Country\", focus on addressing the climate emergency with urgency, rapidly transitioning to a zero-carbon economy, and undertaking a massive effort to restore nature and tackle pollution. The party states that the solutions to the climate crisis are the same as those needed to resolve the cost of living and inequality crises. Here is a summary of the Green Party’s environmental policies across energy, nature, transport, and resource use: 1. Energy and Climate Action The Green Party asserts that the current UK commitment to net zero by 2050 is inadequate, and they plan to transition to a zero-carbon society more than a decade ahead of 2050. • Phasing Out Fossil Fuels: They will push the next government to stop all new fossil fuel extraction projects in the UK, including cancelling recently issued licenses such as Rosebank. They will also end all subsidies to the oil and gas industries. • Carbon Tax: A carbon tax will be introduced on all fossil fuels (domestic or imported), proportional to the greenhouse gas emissions produced when burned. This tax would start at an initial rate of £120 per tonne, progressively rising to a maximum of £500 per tonne of carbon emitted within ten years. This is designed to incentivize reducing emissions rather than paying the tax. • Renewable Energy Targets: They aim for wind power to provide around 70% of the UK’s electricity by 2030. Specific targets by 2035 include achieving 80GW of offshore wind, 53 GW of onshore wind, and 100 GW of solar. • Onshore Wind: They would end the de-facto ban on onshore wind. • Nuclear Power: They would cease development of new nuclear power stations and campaign to phase out existing ones, arguing that nuclear energy is too expensive, slow to develop, and a distraction from renewable energy. • Community Energy: They commit to a minimum threshold of community ownership in all sustainable energy infrastructure and would remove regulatory barriers to community energy. • Biofuels: They would properly regulate biofuels to end greenwashing, ensuring they provide genuine net carbon savings, and end the practice of importing wood for burning at Drax power station and end subsidies for biomass. • Infrastructure: They plan to significantly expand and improve the efficiency of the electricity grid and rapidly expand the capacity for energy storage. 2. Nature, Biodiversity, and Water The UK is described as one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, with about half of its nature lost. The manifesto prioritizes restoring the natural world. • Rights of Nature Act: Introduce a new Rights of Nature Act to grant legal personhood to nature, ensuring it cannot be exploited for financial gain. • Protected Land and Sea: Plan to give 30% of UK land and sea back to nature by 2030, ensuring permanent protection. This includes re-wetting all peatland and increasing unharvested forest and woodland by over 50%. They would also make at least 30% of UK domestic waters into fully protected marine areas by 2030. • Water Companies: The privatization of water is called an \"unmitigated disaster\". The Green Party would take water companies back into public ownership to end pollution, fix leaks, and invest shareholder profits into rebuilding infrastructure. • Water Protection: They would push to restore rivers and take a nature-based solutions approach to prevent flooding and storm overflows. They would increase DEFRA’s budget by £1.5 billion to support environmental protection agencies and develop a soil health monitoring programme. • Pesticides and Farming: The Rights of Nature Act would phase out the most harmful pesticides immediately (including glyphosate) and introduce rigorous tests for all pesticides that demonstrate no harm to pollinators. They plan to nearly triple support for farmers over the next five years to facilitate the transition to nature-friendly farming. • Clean Air: They would push for a Clean Air Act to set new air quality standards and enshrine the right to breathe clean air in the law. 3. Sustainable Transport The party aims to shift the transport system away from reliance on cars and roads, noting that transport accounts for about a quarter of UK carbon emissions. • Public Transport Funding: They would increase annual public subsidies for rail and bus travel to £10 billion by the end of the next parliament. • Infrastructure Investment: Invest an additional £19 billion over five years to improve public transport, electrification, and invest in new cycleways and footpaths, partially by reallocating funding earmarked for road building. They would oppose all new road building plans. • Rail: They would bring the railways back into public ownership and increase investment in modernization and rapid electrification. • Electric Vehicles (EVs): They would push to end sales of new petrol and diesel fueled vehicles by 2027 and end the use of petrol and diesel vehicles on the road by 2035. They favor an extensive vehicle scrappage scheme to support the transition to EVs. • Aviation: They will campaign for a frequent-flyer levy to reduce the impact of the 15% of people who take 70% of flights. They also call for a ban on domestic flights for journeys taking less than three hours by train and a halt to any expansion of airport capacity. 4. Green Homes and Construction The manifesto emphasizes making homes warm, safe, and energy-efficient to tackle fuel poverty and reduce emissions. • Insulation and Retrofit: Implement a £29 billion investment over five years to insulate homes to EPC B standard or above, as part of a ten-year program. • New Building Standards: New homes must meet Passivhaus or equivalent standards and be required to include solar panels and low-carbon heating systems such as heat pumps. • Construction Emissions: They would require full planning applications for demolition, require whole-life carbon and energy calculations for all new applications, and increase disposal rates for builders’ waste to incentivize material reuse. 5. Circular Economy and Resource Use To respect planetary limits, the party advocates for moving away from the exploitation of resources for endless economic growth. • Circular Economy: Advocate for a circular economy that reduces waste. They would require manufacturers to offer ten-year warranties on white goods to encourage repair and reuse, and introduce a comprehensive \"right to repair\" to eliminate built-in obsolescence. • Single-use Plastics: Increase the scope of bans on the production of single-use plastics for packaging and disposable products. • Business Priorities: Campaign to amend the Companies Act 2006 so that company directors must prioritize the well-being of all living entities (including all species and future generations) and avoid negative environmental and social consequences.",
          "brexit": "The Green Party’s views on Brexit, as detailed in their 2024 General Election Manifesto, are explicitly pro-European and focused on working toward rejoining the European Union (EU). The party unequivocally states that it opposed UK withdrawal from the EU and believes that the UK would be better off politically, socially, environmentally, and economically had it maintained its EU membership. They stress that a united international response to global issues is needed now more than ever, and that full membership of the EU remains the best option for the UK. Elected Green MPs commit to working toward specific steps related to Britain’s future in Europe: • Rejoining the EU: The long-term goal is to re-join the EU as soon as the domestic political situation is favourable and EU member states are willing. • Joining the Customs Union: As a first step toward full EU membership, the party proposes joining the Customs Union. They view this action as a way of resolving many of the worst problems resulting from Brexit. • Free Movement: They will work for a speedy return to the free movement of people between the UK and the EU, including reciprocal rights to work for both UK and European citizens. • Erasmus Programme: They commit to rejoining the Erasmus Programme, which enables students to study for a year in another European country. The party also seeks to ensure that musicians have access to visa-free travel to the EU through negotiating a reciprocal arrangement at the earliest possible opportunity. Furthermore, the manifesto notes that leaving the EU was one of the shocks that impacted food supply chains, leading to empty shelves and food price rises.",
          "entire manifesto": "The Green Party’s 2024 General Election Manifesto, titled \"Real Hope. Real Change. Manifesto for a Fairer, Greener Country,\" asserts that the solutions to the climate crisis are the same as those needed to resolve the cost of living and inequality crises. The manifesto aims to transition the UK into a greener, fairer country where citizens are safer, happier, and more fulfilled. The party believes successive governments have failed to prepare for the climate emergency with necessary urgency and ambition, stating that the current commitment to net zero by 2050 is inadequate. The manifesto proposes making political choices that facilitate a rapid shift to a decarbonized economy fueled by clean, green, and cheap renewables, leading to cheaper heating, travel, and business operation. Fairness is intended to permeate all proposed changes, from training a new workforce and investing in public services to establishing a compassionate welfare system. A summary of the manifesto’s key policy areas is provided below: Green Economic Transformation and Public Finances The Green Party commits to a significant investment program, averaging £40 billion per year over the course of the next parliament, to fund a green economic transformation. • Public Ownership: Commit to immediately bringing the railways, water companies, and the Big 5 retail energy companies back into public ownership. • Taxation of Wealth and Pollution: Implement tax reforms designed to raise between £50 billion and £70 billion per year by the end of the next parliament. ◦ Introduce a wealth tax that levies 1% annually on assets above £10 million and 2% on assets above £1 billion. ◦ Align the rates of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and tax on investment income with the rates for employment income. ◦ Introduce a carbon tax on all fossil fuels (domestic or imported), starting at £120 per tonne and progressively rising to a maximum of £500 per tonne of carbon emitted within ten years. • Climate Investment: Allocate £7 billion annually on climate adaptation.

        {
          "crime": "The Reform UK manifesto outlines a comprehensive plan to restore law and order, emphasizing zero tolerance policing, increased police presence, and harsher sentencing for criminals. The manifesto addresses policies concerning Policing, Justice, and immediate actions to be taken in the first 100 days. Here is a summary of the key policies on crime and justice: Policing and Law Enforcement Reforms Reform UK intends to focus on increasing police presence, enforcing stricter standards, and adopting a \"common sense\" approach to law enforcement. • Increase Police Numbers: The plan commits to increasing the UK’s per capita police numbers to 300 per 100,000 population. This equates to 40,000 new front-line officers to be recruited over a 5-year parliamentary term. • Zero Tolerance Policing: The party plans to commence zero tolerance policing, clamping down on all crime and antisocial behavior. This includes substantially increasing the use of Stop and Search. • Mandatory Life Sentences for Drug Crimes: Drug dealing and trafficking will receive mandatory life imprisonment. A new offense of Substantial Possession of Drugs will also meet heavy fines. • Focus on Frontline Policing: Policies aim for More Bobbies on the Beat, ensuring police return to the street, utilizing better technology, and reducing time wasted on paperwork. • New Police Leadership and Recruitment: There will be a strong preference for ex-military officers and personnel in recruitment. High standards of fitness and presentation will be required for front-line officers. • End \"Woke\" Policing: The plan includes scrapping all Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) roles and regulations to prevent two-tier policing. Chief Constables who permit two-tier policing will be sacked. • Reform the Police Oversight Body: The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) will be overhauled to make the police complaints system more accountable and functional for the law-abiding public. • De-Politicise the College of Policing: This includes prioritizing crime prevention, discipline, public service, and high standards of strength and fitness among trainees. The plan also involves replacing degree-standard entry with an entrance exam and requiring officers to complete a 2-year probationary period. Judicial and Sentencing Reforms The manifesto targets judicial reform to ensure criminals face justice and the public is kept safe. • Mandatory Life Sentences for Repeat Offenders: An Urgent Sentencing Review will be launched, implementing automatic life imprisonment for violent repeat offenders. Those committing a second violent or serious offense will receive mandatory life sentences. • Increase Criminal Justice Budget: The budget will be increased from £10 billion to £12 billion to ensure more high-caliber staff are available to cut court delays. • Expand Prison Capacity: The plan involves the immediate start of building 10,000 new detention places to expand the capacity of state-built and managed prisons. Disused military bases may also be commissioned if needed. The goal is to ensure that \"life means life\" for those who endanger the public. • Reopen Local Courts: Local magistrates’ courts will be reopened to clear the case backlog. • Reform Hate Crime Definition: The definition of hate crime used by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and police will be changed, asserting that members of the public should not be investigated because \"any\" person \"perceives\" that a hate crime has been committed, due to the existing definition leading to systemic bias. • Tackle Child Grooming Gangs: This policy includes deporting offenders holding dual citizenship, making child grooming an aggravating offense, improving safeguarding for victims, and implementing no bail for grooming gang offenders. • Youth Crime: High Intensity Training Camps will be reopened for young offenders to teach basic education, teamwork, and values. Critical Reforms from Other Policy Areas Impacting Crime Immigration and constitutional changes also contain provisions directly related to crime and security: • Immediate Deportation of Foreign Criminals: Foreign nationals are to be deported immediately after their prison sentence ends. Citizenship will be withdrawn from immigrants who commit crimes, excluding some misdemeanor offenses. • Leaving the ECHR: The plan includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and commencing reform of the Human Rights Act to prioritize the rights of law-abiding people. • Anti-Corruption Unit: An Anti-Corruption Unit for Westminster will be launched with legal powers to investigate past and future scandals, ensuring public officials face sanctions, including prison, if they break the rules. The total cost estimated for the Policing pledges is £3 billion per year, and for Justice pledges, the cost is £2 billion per year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The overall approach to crime and justice in the manifesto is akin to a reset button on law enforcement. It aims to shift resources from administrative and diversity roles to the frontline, combine severe punitive measures (like mandatory life sentences and increased deportations) with expanded physical infrastructure (prisons and training camps), and ensure the police force and justice system operate under a mandate of \"zero tolerance\" and high discipline.",
          "healthcare": "The Reform UK manifesto outlines significant reforms for the National Health Service (NHS), aiming to achieve zero waiting lists while maintaining healthcare free at the point of delivery. The key policies focus on staff retention, improving efficiency, utilizing independent healthcare capacity, and cutting administrative waste. Here is a summary of the key policies regarding the NHS and healthcare: Core Pledge and Objective The central commitment related to healthcare is: • Imagine No NHS Waiting Lists: Healthcare will remain free at the point of delivery. Reforms will be implemented to improve outcomes and achieve zero NHS waiting lists. • The strategy involves cutting back office waste to dedicate more money to the frontline, and offering tax breaks for doctors and nurses to address the staffing crisis. Staffing and Recruitment Reforms To address chronic staff shortages, Reform UK proposes immediate financial incentives and changes to training: • Zero Basic Rate Tax for Frontline Staff: All frontline NHS and social care staff will pay zero basic rate tax for 3 years. This measure aims to retain existing staff and attract those who have left to return to service. • Student Fee Write-Offs: Student fees will be written off pro rata over 10 years of NHS service for all doctors, nurses, and medical staff who commit to the service. • End Training Caps: Training caps for all UK medical students will be ended. Utilizing Independent and Private Healthcare The manifesto proposes integrating independent services to relieve pressure on the NHS: • Tax Relief on Private Healthcare: Implement Tax Relief of 20% on all private healthcare and insurance. This is intended to grow independent healthcare capacity rapidly, provide competition, reduce costs, and, crucially, relieve pressure on the NHS to improve care for all who rely on it. • Harness Independent Capacity: The plan includes harnessing independent and not-for-profit health provision in the UK and overseas. • NHS Voucher Scheme: Later reforms will include putting patients in charge with a New NHS Voucher Scheme. NHS patients will receive a voucher for private treatment if they cannot see a GP within 3 days, a consultant within 3 weeks, or receive an operation within 9 weeks. Efficiency, Waste Reduction, and Management Policies are aimed at increasing productivity and cutting bureaucracy: • Cut Waste and Unnecessary Managers: Operating theatres must be open on weekends, and rotas must be planned further in advance. • Financial Scrutiny: Review all NHS Private Finance Contracts for significant savings potential. • Charge for Missed Appointments: Charge those who fail to attend medical appointments without notice. • Abolish NHS Race and Health Observatory: This specific body will be abolished. Primary and Emergency Care Steps to manage pressure on emergency services include: • Save A&E: Launch a campaign of \"Pharmacy First, GP Second, A&E Last\" to cut waiting times. • Tax Incentives for Pharmacies: Offer tax incentives for new pharmacies and those who employ more staff to assist in relieving pressure on A&E. Public Inquiry into Excess Deaths The plan also includes a specific investigation: • Excess Deaths and Vaccine Harms Public Inquiry: A public inquiry will be launched because excess deaths are currently nearly as high as they were during the Covid pandemic, with young people being over-represented. Financial Commitment The total annualized cost of the NHS pledges is estimated to be £17 billion. The overarching goal is a reformed NHS focused on \"Patients first. Rapid care. Cutting waste\".",
          "housing": "The Reform UK manifesto addresses the housing crisis with policies focused on boosting housebuilding, particularly on brownfield sites, reforming the planning system, and adjusting tax and tenancy laws for the rental market. The housing pledges are estimated to be cost neutral. Here is a summary of the key policies on housing: Planning and Construction The core of the housebuilding strategy revolves around reforming planning to accelerate development and incentivizing new technology. • Review the Planning System: The manifesto calls for a review of the planning system. • Fast-track Brownfield Development: Reform UK plans to fast-track planning and provide tax incentives specifically for the development of brownfield sites. • \"Loose Fit Planning\": They propose a \"loose fit planning\" policy for large residential developments, which would involve pre-approved guidelines and established developer requirements. • Incentivize New Construction Technology: The party will incentivize innovation to speed up building, specifically mentioning modular construction, digital technology, and building sites that improve efficiency and cut waste. Rental Market and Landlord Reforms The policies aim to encourage smaller landlords into the market by adjusting the tax system and overturning existing legislation. • Scrap Section 24 for Landlords: Reform UK intends to scrap Section 24, which refers to tax rules that currently penalize smaller landlords. They plan to restore landlords’ rights to deduct finance costs and mortgage interest from tax on rental income to encourage participation in the rental markets. • Abolish the Renters’ (Reform) Bill: The manifesto states that the existing Renters’ (Reform) Bill was inadequate. Instead of this bill, they plan to boost the monitoring, appeals, and enforcement processes available for renters who have grievances. Social Housing and Residency Priority Reform UK plans to prioritize local citizens in the social housing allocation system: • Reform Social Housing Law: The policy is to prioritize local people and those who have paid into the system for social housing. • Foreign Nationals in Queue: Foreign nationals must go to the back of the queue for social housing, \"Not the front\". Property Taxation and Leasehold Reform Policies also include changes to taxes on property transactions and protections for leaseholders. • Cut Residential Stamp Duty: Although this policy is listed under \"Economy - Personal,\" it directly impacts housing affordability. Reform UK intends to cut Residential Stamp Duty to 0% below £750k. It would be cut to 2% from £750k - £1.5m and to 4% over £1.5m. This is intended to substantially boost economic activity and housebuilding. • Protection for Leaseholders: The party plans to ensure all potential charges for leasehold or freehold residents are clearly stated and consented to. They will enforce Section 106 agreements and ensure it is cheaper and easier to extend leases to 990 years and buy freeholds. The manifesto notes that the unprecedented population explosion in the UK has contributed to the existing housing crisis. Reform UK’s commitment to freezing non-essential immigration is listed as a core pledge intended to \"end the housing crisis\".",
          "immigration": "The Reform UK manifesto places a strong emphasis on drastically reducing immigration, securing borders, and implementing stricter controls on who can enter and remain in the UK. The document states that record mass immigration has damaged the country, leading to crises in housing, benefits, crime, and NHS waiting lists, while also damaging British culture and identity [2 states that record mass immigration has damaged the country, leading to crises in housing, benefits, crime, and NHS waiting lists, while also damaging British culture and identity. The immigration plan is encapsulated in a Core Pledge and a series of Critical Reforms intended for the first 100 days of a Reform UK government. Core Pledges The manifesto summarizes its position on immigration into two core pledges: 1. Smart Immigration, Not Mass Immigration: This involves freezing all non-essential immigration to boost wages, protect public services, end the housing crisis, and cut crime. 2. No More Small Boats in the Channel: The policy dictates that illegal migrants who come to the UK will be detained and deported. If necessary, migrants in small boats will be picked up and taken back to France. Critical Reforms (First 100 Days) The following specific policies are detailed to be implemented rapidly: Immigration Freeze and Exceptions • Freeze Non-Essential Immigration: Strict limits on immigration will be imposed, with essential skills, mainly those concerning healthcare, being the only exception. This is intended to relieve pressure on housing and public services, increase wages, and protect culture, identity, and values. Stopping Illegal Migration (\"Stop the Boats\") • 4 Point Plan: This plan is designed to stop the small boats crisis : 1. Leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). 2. Ensure zero illegal immigrants are resettled in the UK. 3. Create a New Department of Immigration. 4. Pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France. • Secure Detention and Asylum: All asylum seekers arriving illegally from safe countries will be processed rapidly, potentially offshore. Those entering from a safe country will be barred from claiming asylum or citizenship. • No Legal Aid: Non-citizens will be provided with no legal aid. Rejected asylum seekers will be returned. Financial and Benefits Controls • Employer Immigration Tax (EIT): The National Insurance rate will be raised to 20% for foreign workers. This is meant to incentivize businesses to employ British citizens (whose National Insurance rate would remain at 13.8%). Essential foreign health and care workers, and businesses employing five staff members or fewer, would be exempt. This tax is projected to raise over £20 billion over five years to fund apprenticeships and training for young Britons. • Stop Health Tourism and Immediate Access to Benefits: A requirement of 5 years residency and employment will be imposed to claim any benefits in the UK. Student and Criminal Immigration • Bar Student Dependents: New visa rules for international students will be introduced to bar dependents. • Skills Retention: Only international students with essential skills will be allowed to remain in the UK. • Close Abusive Schemes: Fake courses and immigration schemes that abuse the rules will be closed down. • Immediate Deportation for Foreign Criminals: Foreign nationals are to be deported immediately after their prison sentence ends. The party plans to withdraw citizenship from immigrants who commit crime, excluding some misdemeanor offenses. Financial Implications The Immigration pledges are projected to result in annual savings ranging from £5 to £10 billion. The Employer Immigration Tax is projected to raise an additional £4 billion per annum. The total projected annual savings from Immigration is £9 billion to £14 billion.",
          "defence": "The Reform UK manifesto outlines policies aimed at strengthening the armed forces, improving support for servicemen and women, and increasing defense spending to ensure Britain’s security and global standing. Here is a summary of the key defense policies: Investment and Spending Reform UK plans a significant increase in defense spending over the coming years : • Increase Defence Spending: Defense spending will be increased to 2.5% of National GDP by year 3, and then further increased to 3% within 6 years. • Purpose of Increased Funding: This increase is intended to boost the size and capacity of the armed forces, ensure the UK’s leading role in NATO, improve equipment, enhance the quality of life for service personnel, and boost morale in military communities. • Cost: The total annualized cost of the Defense Pledges is estimated at £14 billion. Personnel, Recruitment, and Support Policies are focused on better compensating, protecting, and supporting service members, both during and after their service. • Urgent Pay Review: An urgent pay review will be introduced to increase basic pay across the armed forces to boost both recruitment and retention. The manifesto notes that it is \"unacceptable that a private soldier is paid less than an Amazon worker\". • Recruitment: The party plans to recruit 30,000 for the army. Military national service for young people is explicitly stated as \"not the answer\". • New Armed Forces Justice Bill: This bill will be introduced to protect servicemen and women on active duty both inside and outside the UK from civil law and human rights lawyers. • Armed Forces Watchdog: The bill will also create an armed forces watchdog to fast-track complaints and appeals related to housing and welfare. • Dedicated Veterans Department: A new, dedicated Ministerial Department for Veterans will be established. This department must be \"properly funded and resourced\" to guarantee that \"no veteran goes without\" and that former service members play a leading role in society and the economy. • Education: Free education both during and after service is considered vital to ensure a successful return to civilian life. Equipment and Procurement Reforms are planned to improve the procurement process and regenerate the UK’s defense industry. • Reform Defence Procurement: A Joint Acquisition Corp will be launched to ensure world-class procurement. The Ministry of Defence must prioritize listening to soldiers on the front line to ensure they receive the equipment they need. • Regenerate UK Defence Industry: Incentives and tax breaks will be introduced to boost the UK defense manufacturing and technology sector. • Improve Self-Sufficiency: The goal is to improve equipment self-sufficiency and manufacture world-class products for export. Constitutional and External Military Independence The manifesto also addresses independence from external military forces, specifically concerning the EU : • Independence for Britain’s Armed Forces: Reform UK plans to ensure independence for Britain’s Armed Forces. The government has signed up to the EU Horizon programme, meaning the UK sends money to the European Defence Fund and is part of the EU’s military mobility project, which the manifesto views as risking the UK Armed Forces being \"sucked into an EU Command and Control Force\".",
          "economy": "The Reform UK manifesto presents a wide-ranging plan for economic reform, centered on reducing taxation, slashing government waste, eliminating regulations perceived as detrimental to growth, and ending Net Zero policies to secure cheap energy. The overall objective is to \"make work pay\" and restore \"real economic growth\". The economic policies are structured across measures relating to personal finances, businesses, and government spending. 1. Taxation and Personal Finance (Economy – Personal) The core pledge here is to lift the Income Tax starting threshold to £20,000 per year. • Income Tax: Lifting the starting point to £20,000 frees up to 7 million people from paying Income Tax and saves every worker almost £1,500 per year. The basic tax rate remains at 20%, and the higher rate should begin at £70,000. • Energy Taxes: Policies aimed at beating the cost-of-living crisis include saving households over £500 per year by scrapping VAT on energy bills and abolishing environmental levies. • Fuel Duty: Fuel duty will be lowered by 20p per litre for both residential and business users. • Property Tax: Residential Stamp Duty will be cut to 0% below £750k (2% between £750k - £1.5m, and 4% over £1.5m) to substantially boost economic activity and housebuilding. • Inheritance Tax (IHT): IHT will be abolished for all estates under £2m, covering approximately 98% of all estates. The rate above £2m will be 20% tax, with the option to donate to charity instead. • Tourism: The VAT Tourist Tax (the VAT refund scheme for tourist shopping) will be abolished, which the sources claim has cost the economy over £10 billion and deterred up to 2 million tourists. These personal tax pledges are estimated to cost £70 billion per annum. 2. Business and Corporate Reform (Economy – Business) Reform UK intends to back \"risk takers and wealth creators\" by simplifying the tax system and reducing corporate burdens. • Corporation Tax: Over 1.2 million Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMEs) will be freed from Corporation Tax by lifting the minimum profit threshold to £100k. The main Corporation Tax Rate will be reduced from 25% down to 20%, and then to 15% from Year 3. • Self-Employment: The party plans to Abolish IR35 Rules to support sole traders. • VAT and Business Rates: The VAT Threshold will be lifted to £150,000 to free small entrepreneurs from red tape. Business Rates will be abolished for high street based SMEs, offset by a new Online Delivery Tax at 4% for large, multinational enterprises. • Entrepreneurs’ Tax: Entrepreneurs’ tax will be cut to 5%. • Regulation and Planning: The party will slash red tape to boost industry and exports, including scrapping thousands of laws that hold back British business, such as employment laws, to make it easier to hire and fire. They also plan to reform the planning system and fast-track new housing on brownfield sites and infrastructure projects. These business pledges are estimated to cost £18 billion per annum. 3. Government Waste and Savings A major component of Reform UK’s economic plan involves significant cuts to government spending to fund the tax reductions. • Quantitative Easing (QE) Reserves: The most substantial saving is projected from requiring the Bank of England to stop paying interest to commercial banks on QE Reserves, which Reform UK estimates would save around £35 billion per year. • Departmental Savings: Every government department must slash wasteful spending, cut bureaucracy, and improve efficiency to Save £5 in every £100, projected to save £50 billion per year without touching frontline services. • Foreign Aid: Foreign Aid will be cut by 50%, saving £6 billion from the £12.8 billion budget. • Regulations and Brexit: The party plans to cut unnecessary regulations, noting that Britain still retains over 6,700 EU laws, and government red tape is estimated to have cost the UK economy £143 billion since 2015. • Tax Collection: Improved competence at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is expected to collect \"£ Billions\" in unpaid tax due to understaffing and bad management. Total potential savings from slashing government waste are projected at £91 billion per annum. 4. Energy Policy and Economic Growth Policies focused on energy and climate are central to the economic strategy, framed as necessary to restore growth and beat the cost-of-living crisis. • Scrap Net Zero: The party will Scrap Net Zero policies and related subsidies, potentially saving the public sector over £30 billion per year. • Renewable Subsidies: Annual £10 billion of Renewable Energy Subsidies will be scrapped. • Energy Production: Cheap, secure energy will be pursued by fast-tracking licences for North Sea gas and oil and granting shale gas licences. • Growth Assumption: Reform UK projects that its economic reforms will create 1% to 1.5% extra growth per annum. This extra growth is assumed to yield £10 billion per annum of extra tax revenues. Financial Summary Reform UK projects that the combined potential savings (including the Employer Immigration Tax and transport savings) and extra growth total £160 billion per annum. This figure exceeds the total estimated cost of all pledges, which is £141 billion. The sources note that the UK economy is currently being wrecked by record high taxes, record high national debt, wasteful government spending, and nanny state regulations.",
          "education": "The Reform UK manifesto outlines several key policies for education, focusing on curriculum reform, banning certain ideologies from schools, providing incentives for independent education, and overhauling the university loan system. The goal is to ensure young people are taught the skills, character, and values necessary to succeed in life while being proud of Britain. The education pledges are estimated to cost £5 billion per annum. Curriculum and Ideology The party plans to introduce fundamental changes to what is taught and discussed in schools: • Patriotic Curriculum: A Patriotic Curriculum will be introduced in primary and secondary schools. ◦ Any teaching about British or European imperialism or slavery must be paired with the teaching of a non-European occurrence of the same to ensure balance. ◦ The History and social science curriculum will be reviewed and audited regularly to ensure balance. ◦ Children must be taught about their heritage. • Ban Transgender Ideology: Reform UK plans to ban Transgender Ideology in primary and secondary schools. ◦ This means no gender questioning, social transitioning, or pronoun swapping will be allowed. ◦ Schools must have single-sex facilities. ◦ Parents of under 16s must be informed about their children’s life decisions. • Permanent Exclusions: The number of Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) will be doubled to ensure schools can function safely by enabling permanent exclusions for violent and disruptive students. Best practices will also be spread across PRUs. Independent Education and Universities The manifesto includes policies designed to support parents who choose private schooling and reform higher education financing: • Support for Independent Education: Tax relief of 20% on all Independent Education will be implemented, and there will be No VAT on Fees. This is intended to incentivize parents who can afford to pay more to choose independent schools, thereby significantly easing pressure on state schools and improving education for all. • Student Loans: The policy proposes to Scrap Interest on Student Loans. ◦ Loan capital repayment periods will be extended to 45 years. ◦ Undergraduate numbers will be restricted well below current levels, as the sources note that \"too many courses are not good enough and students are being ripped off\". ◦ Minimum entry standards will be enforced. • Free Speech at Universities: Funding will be Cut to Universities that Undermine Free Speech. The manifesto criticizes the government’s Free Speech Act as \"toothless\" and states that allowing political bias or cancel culture must face heavy financial penalties. • Two-Year Undergraduate Courses: Universities must provide the option of 2-year undergraduate courses to reduce student debt and allow earlier entry into employment. Overall, the policy direction seeks to inject common sense and patriotic values into the school system while simultaneously utilizing private capacity and fiscal reforms to tackle systemic debt and lack of standards in higher education.",
          "environment": "The Reform UK manifesto’s core environmental policies are defined by its commitment to scrapping Net Zero targets and focusing instead on energy security, affordability, and traditional conservation methods. These policies are centralized under the heading \"Net Zero\". Here is a summary of the key policies on the environment and energy: Core Policy: Scrap Net Zero The party asserts that Net Zero is crippling the economy and is responsible for pushing up bills, damaging British industries like steel, and decreasing national security. • Scrap Net Zero and Subsidies: The manifesto mandates scrapping Net Zero policies and all related subsidies. Ditching Net Zero is projected to save the public sector over £30 billion per year for the next 25 years. • Scrap Renewable Energy Subsidies: The party plans to scrap the annual £10 billion of Renewable Energy Subsidies by achieving equivalent taxes on them. The sources note that current high bills have increased dramatically in line with the huge rise in renewables capacity over the last 15 years. Energy Production and Affordability The primary goal of energy policy is to secure cheap, stable energy for Britain and beat the cost-of-living crisis. • Unlock Oil and Gas Reserves: Reform UK will unlock Britain’s vast oil and gas reserves to unleash real economic growth. • Fast-track Licences: They plan to start fast-track licenses for North Sea gas and oil. • Shale Gas: The party will grant shale gas licences on test sites for two years, enabling major production when safety is proven, alongside local compensation schemes. • Cleaner Energy from New Technology: The manifesto supports fast-tracking clean nuclear energy with new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) built in Britain. They also advocate for increasing and incentivizing ethical UK lithium mining, combined cycle gas turbines, clean synthetic fuel, tidal power, and exploring clean coal mining. Environmental Protection (Non-Climate Related) While rejecting the Net Zero agenda, the manifesto proposes alternative ways to protect the environment: • Conservation Focus: The party states that the environment can be protected through measures like more tree planting, more recycling, and less single-use plastics. • Country Sports: They support protecting country sports, arguing that they increase investment and help with conservation of the environment. Impact on Farming and Infrastructure These policies also directly impact land use and transport: • Scrap Climate-Related Farming Subsidies: Productive land must be farmed, not be used for solar farms or rewilding. Current subsidies will be replaced with direct payments. • Stop the War on Drivers: Scrapping Net Zero means there will be no more bans on petrol and diesel cars and no legal requirements for manufacturers to sell electric cars. • Infrastructure: The party plans to simplify infrastructure funding streams by overhauling the National Infrastructure Commission and the Infrastructure Bank and scrapping Net Zero objectives. The overall financial commitment indicates that the \"Net Zero Pledges\" are projected to generate £30 billion per annum in savings. The party views existing Net Zero targets as pushing the UK to \"impoverish ourselves in pursuit of unaffordable, unachievable global CO2 targets\".",
          "brexit": "The Reform UK manifesto emphasizes the necessity of doing what the Conservative government has failed to do: \"grasp the huge opportunities of Brexit\". The core objective is to fully realize the promise of taking back control of Britain’s borders, money, and laws. Here is a summary of the key policies related to Brexit: Legislative and Regulatory Independence The primary policy focus is the rapid removal of retained European Union (EU) law: • Scrap EU Regulations: Reform UK pledges to Legislate to Scrap EU Regulations with Immediate Effect. The manifesto notes that Britain still retains over 6,700 retained EU laws, which the party intends to rescind. • Key Law Areas Affected: British laws on State Aid, Competition, Employment, Net Zero, and the Environment are still based on EU regulations, and these areas will be targeted for legislative independence. Northern Ireland and the Windsor Framework A critical policy is the abandonment of the current agreement governing Northern Ireland’s relationship with the EU: • Abandon the Windsor Framework: Reform UK plans to Abandon the Windsor Framework, arguing that it is \"worse than the original Northern Ireland Protocol\". • Partition and EU Law: The party states that the UK has been partitioned down the Irish Sea, and that Northern Ireland remains in the EU’s single market for goods. This situation is deemed \"unacceptable\" because British citizens in Northern Ireland are being ruled by EU laws. Future Trade and Military Independence The manifesto also addresses future relationships with the EU regarding trade and defense: • Renegotiate the Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Reform UK intends to Prepare for Renegotiations on the EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The manifesto states that the so-called EU \"level playing field\" requirements are currently holding the UK back. • Independence for the Armed Forces: The party will ensure the independence of Britain’s Armed Forces. The manifesto criticizes the government for signing up to the EU Horizon programme, which results in the UK sending money to the European Defence Fund and being part of the EU’s military mobility project. This involvement is seen as risking the UK Armed Forces being \"sucked into an EU Command and Control Force\". Fisheries A separate section is dedicated to seizing the opportunity to renew the fishing industry, which was a core issue during the Brexit referendum: • Stop EU Fishers Taking UK Quotas: The party will End automatic access to UK waters for EU fishers. • Licensing and Policing: Every foreign fishing vessel must pay for a licence to gain access to the UK’s 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Royal Navy Overseas Patrol Squadron will be expanded to properly police this EEZ. • Ban Supertrawlers: Foreign supertrawlers will be banned from UK waters. • Rebuild UK Processing: Tax and other incentives will be introduced to ensure that all fish caught in British waters are landed and processed in the UK. The sources confirm that Brexit provides an \"opportunity of a lifetime\" , and the aim of Reform UK’s policies is to fully unlock these \"major opportunities\". The overall economic reforms outlined in the manifesto, including those specifically linked to Brexit, are projected to contribute to an extra £10 billion per annum in tax revenues from increased economic growth.",
          "entire manifesto": "The Reform UK manifesto, \"Our Contract with You,\" outlines a comprehensive plan focusing on significant reforms across various sectors, often prioritizing measures to cut taxes, curb immigration, overhaul public services, and reduce government waste. The document begins by summarizing its plan into Five Core Pledges : 1. Smart Immigration, Not Mass Immigration: This involves freezing all non-essential immigration to boost wages, protect public services, end the housing crisis, and cut crime. 2. No More Small Boats in the Channel: The policy states that illegal migrants arriving in the UK will be detained and deported, and migrants in small boats will be picked up and taken back to France. 3. No NHS Waiting Lists: While remaining free at the point of delivery, healthcare will undergo reform to achieve zero waiting lists, cut back office waste, and offer tax breaks for doctors and nurses to address the staffing crisis. 4. Good Wages for a Hard Day’s Work: This aims to lift the income tax starting threshold to £20,000 per year, saving the lowest paid £1,500 annually and taking 7 million people out of Income Tax to incentivize work. 5. Affordable, Stable Energy Bills: This pledge involves scrapping energy levies and Net Zero policies to slash energy bills (saving each household £500 per year) and unlocking Britain’s vast oil and gas reserves to promote economic growth.

          "crime": "The Labour manifesto outlines a comprehensive plan under the mission \"Take back our streets\" to halve serious violent crime and raise confidence in the police and criminal justice system to its highest levels. The party aims to stop the \"Conservative chaos\" and return law and order to the streets. Key policies and measures focused on crime, policing, and justice include: 1. Policing and Neighbourhood Safety • Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee: Labour will introduce a new Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee to restore patrols to town centres by recruiting thousands of new police officers, Police and Community Support Officers (PCSOs), and special constables. • Named Officers: Communities and residents will have a named officer to contact when issues arise. • Funding for New Recruits: These new recruits will be funded by tackling waste through a new Police Efficiency and Collaboration programme for England and Wales, which will establish nation-wide standards for procurement and shared services to drive down costs. The plan allocates £400 million (annualized) from this efficiency program to fund 13,000 additional neighbourhood police and community PCSOs, as well as specialist domestic abuse advisers in 999 control rooms. • Failing Forces: His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire & Rescue Services will be given \"new powers to intervene with failing forces\". • Professional Standards: The manifesto commits to raising standards by introducing mandatory professional standards on vetting, checks, and misconduct for individual officers. • Misconduct: Stronger training on racism and violence against women and girls will be implemented, and anyone with a history of violence against women and girls will be barred from the service. Furthermore, automatic suspensions will be introduced if officers are investigated for domestic abuse and sexual offences. 2. Tackling Antisocial Behaviour and Shoplifting • Respect Orders: New Respect Orders will be introduced to ban persistent adult offenders from town centres, aiming to stamp out issues like public drinking and drug use. • Restorative Justice: Fly-tippers and vandals will be forced to clean up the mess they have created. • Shoplifting: Labour will scrap the effective immunity for some shoplifting introduced by the Conservatives and create a new specific offence for assaults on shopworkers to protect them from threats and violence. 3. Knife Crime and Youth Intervention • Halving Knife Crime: The manifesto sets the goal to halve knife crime in a decade. • Tough Consequences: Labour will end the practice of empty warnings by ensuring that knife carrying triggers rapid intervention and tough consequences. • Mandatory Plans: Every young person caught with a knife will be referred to a Youth Offending Team and receive a mandatory plan to prevent reoffending, potentially including penalties such as curfews, tagging, and custody for the most serious cases. • Bans on Weapons: To get knives off the streets, Labour will ban ninja swords, lethal zombie-style blades, and machetes. Rules will be strengthened to prevent online sales, and executives of online companies flouting these rules will be personally held to account through tough sanctions. • Young Futures Programme: A new Young Futures programme will be created, featuring a network of hubs in every community. These hubs will provide youth workers, mental health support workers, and careers advisers to intervene earlier and stop young people from being drawn into crime. • Funding Youth Support: Youth workers and mentors will be placed in A&E units and Pupil Referral Units, funded by the full recovery of the cost of firearm licensing (reallocating £20 million annually). • Criminal Exploitation: A new offence of criminal exploitation of children will be introduced to target gangs luring young people into violence and crime. 4. Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) • Specialist Teams: Labour’s landmark mission is to halve violence against women and girls in a decade. To achieve this, there will be specialist rape and sexual offences teams in every police force. • Targeting Perpetrators: The most prolific and harmful perpetrators will be relentlessly targeted, using tactics typically reserved for terrorists and organized crime. • Fast-Tracking Cases: Labour will fast-track rape cases with specialist courts at every Crown Court location in England and Wales to address shamefully low prosecution rates and long delays. • Victim Support: Domestic abuse experts will be introduced in 999 control rooms so victims can speak directly to a specialist, and a legal advocate will be present in every police force area to advise victims from report to trial. Legal advocates will be funded by redirecting PCC grants for victims’ services (reallocating £5 million annually). • Addressing Root Causes: Schools will be required to address misogyny and teach young people about healthy relationships and consent. • Stalking and Spiking: Labour will strengthen the use of Stalking Protection Orders, give women the right to know the identity of online stalkers, and introduce a new criminal offence for spiking. 5. Criminal Justice System and Prisons • Solving Crime: Labour aims to reverse plummeting charge and prosecution rates by reducing barriers to bringing charges, cutting bureaucracy, and improving collaboration between police and prosecutors. • Detectives: A direct entry scheme for detectives will be rolled out to boost investigation skills. • Courts Backlog: Associate Prosecutors will be allowed to work on appropriate cases as an initial step to address the courts backlog. • Sentencing Review: A review of sentencing will be carried out to ensure it is up to date, particularly for offences against women and girls. • Prison Crisis: Labour will use all relevant powers to build the prisons needed to address overcrowding and chaos. They will also act to reduce reoffending by improving offenders’ access to purposeful activity (like learning) and ensuring pre-release plans are created, linking ex-offenders with local employers and the voluntary sector. • Probation: A strategic review of probation governance will be conducted, considering the benefits of devolved models (as pioneered by Labour Mayors, like in Greater Manchester) to ensure better coordination with housing and health services. 6. Serious and Organised Crime • Fraud: Given that fraud accounts for almost two in five crimes, Labour will introduce a new expanded fraud strategy to tackle online, public sector, and serious fraud, and will work with technology companies to prevent their platforms from being exploited. • Cybercrime: The police will be enabled to invest in specialist capabilities, such as digital forensics, and more effectively tackle cross-border issues like serious organised crime. 7. Border Security and Small Boats While categorized under \"Secure Borders\" (a strong foundation for good government), these policies are crime-related and target criminal gangs : • Border Security Command: Labour will create a new Border Security Command with hundreds of new investigators, intelligence officers, and cross-border police officers. • Funding: This Command will be funded by ending the \"wasteful\" Migration and Economic Development partnership with Rwanda, and the Command will be supported by new counter-terrorism style powers to pursue and disrupt those responsible for the vile trade of people smuggling. • Asylum Backlog: The party will hire additional caseworkers to clear the backlog of asylum cases and end the use of asylum hotels, saving billions. New measures to clear the backlog are funded by reallocating £155 million (annualized). • Returns and Enforcement: A new returns and enforcement unit will be set up with an additional 1,000 staff to fast-track removals of people who do not have the right to stay here, and Labour will negotiate additional returns arrangements with safe countries. In essence, Labour aims to shift policing back toward visible, preventive community presence while applying tough, specialized enforcement measures against serious crimes like knife crime, sexual violence, and the criminal organizations driving border chaos.",
          "healthcare": "The Labour manifesto outlines its healthcare policies under the mission to \"Build an NHS fit for the future that is there when people need it\". The party emphasizes that the NHS must remain publicly owned and publicly funded, but investment alone is not enough; it must go hand-in-hand with fundamental reform. The central goals are to address the immediate crisis of long waiting lists and transform the NHS from a \"sickness service\" to one focused on prevention and long-term care. Core Mission and Waiting Times • NHS Fit for the Future: The mission aims to ensure the NHS is available when people need it, with fewer lives lost to major killers, and ensure people live well for longer. • Cutting Waiting Lists: Labour’s immediate priority is to get a grip on the record waiting lists. ◦ They aim to return to meeting NHS performance standards, meaning patients should wait no longer than 18 weeks from referral for consultant-led treatment of non-urgent conditions. ◦ Extra Appointments: As a first step, Labour will deliver an extra two million NHS operations, scans, and appointments every year in England, equating to 40,000 more appointments every week. ◦ These appointments will be scheduled during evenings and weekends, paid for by cracking down on tax avoidance and non-dom loopholes. ◦ Resource Pooling: Resources will be pooled across neighboring hospitals to introduce shared waiting lists, allowing patients to be treated quicker. ◦ Independent Sector: Labour will use spare capacity in the independent sector to ensure patients are diagnosed and treated more quickly. Modernizing Equipment and Technology • Doubling Scanners: Labour will introduce a new \"Fit For the Future\" fund to double the number of CT and MRI scanners. This is intended to help catch cancer and other conditions earlier, saving lives. This fund is costed at £250 million (2028-29). • Digital Transformation: The party seeks to harness the power of technologies like AI to transform the speed and accuracy of diagnostic services. • NHS App: Labour plans to transform the NHS app, putting patients in control of their own health to manage medicine, appointments, and health needs. This includes providing performance information on local services, vaccination and health check notifications, and medical guidelines so patients can hold services accountable. • Life Sciences Strategy: The party will develop an NHS innovation and adoption strategy in England, reforming incentive structures and speeding up regulatory approval for new technology and medicines. They also aim to maximize the UK’s potential to lead the world in clinical trials, especially for conditions like dementia, by making the process more efficient via the NHS app. • New Hospitals Programme: Labour is committed to delivering the New Hospitals Programme, recognizing that NHS estates are in disrepair. Primary Care and Dentistry • Neighbourhood Health Service: The manifesto calls for a shift toward a Neighbourhood Health Service, with more care delivered in local communities to spot problems earlier, and a long-term shift of resources to primary care and community services. • The Family Doctor: Labour will work to bring back the family doctor by incentivizing GPs to see the same patient, effectively dealing with ongoing or complex conditions. • GP Appointments: They will train thousands more GPs, guarantee a face-to-face appointment for all who want one, and deliver a modern appointment booking system to end the \"8am scramble\". • Pharmacy and Opticians: Pressure will be taken off GP surgeries by creating a Community Pharmacist Prescribing Service, granting more pharmacists the right to prescribe common medicines. Other professionals, such as opticians, will be allowed to make direct referrals to specialist services or tests, expanding self-referral routes. • Dentistry Rescue Plan: Labour will tackle the immediate crisis in dentistry by providing 700,000 more urgent dental appointments annually. ◦ This plan is costed at £125 million (2028-29). ◦ Long-term reform includes shifting the dental contract to focus on prevention and the retention of NHS dentists. ◦ A supervised tooth-brushing scheme will be introduced for 3- to 5-year-olds, targeting the areas of highest need. Mental Health and Prevention • Mental Health Staff: Labour will recruit an additional 8,500 new staff in its first term to treat children and adults. These new staff will be specially trained to support people at risk of suicide. This policy is costed at £410 million (2028-29), funded by closing the carried interest tax loophole. • Young Futures Hubs: Mental health services will be provided through the new Young Futures hubs, offering open-access support for children and young people in every community. • School Mental Health: Access to specialist mental health professionals will be provided in every school. • Modernizing Mental Health Act: Labour will modernize mental health legislation to give patients greater choice, autonomy, enhanced rights, and support, and address the disproportionate detention rates of Black people and the treatment of those with autism and learning difficulties. • Public Health: Prevention is a key focus. Labour will introduce public health measures to tackle the biggest killers: ◦ Smoking: Ensure the next generation can never legally buy cigarettes and integrate \"opt-out\" smoking cessation interventions into routine hospital care. ◦ Vaping: Ban vapes from being branded and advertised to appeal to children. ◦ Obesity: Commit to banning advertising junk food to children and the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to under-16s. • Health Inequalities: Labour aims to tackle the social determinants of health and halve the gap in healthy life expectancy between the richest and poorest regions in England. Social Care Reform • National Care Service: Labour will undertake a programme of reform to create a National Care Service, underpinned by national standards, ensuring consistency of care across the country. • Home First: Services will be locally delivered, built on a \"home first\" principle to support people living independently for as long as possible. • Workforce: A Fair Pay Agreement in adult social care will be established as a sector collective agreement, setting fair pay, terms and conditions, along with training standards. • Rights and Integration: Guarantee the rights of those in residential care to be able to see their families and improve local partnership working between the NHS and social care on hospital discharge. Women’s and Children’s Health • Maternity Care: Trusts failing on maternity care will be robustly supported into rapid improvement, and thousands more midwives will be trained as part of the NHS Workforce Plan. • Maternal Mortality: An explicit target will be set to close the Black and Asian maternal mortality gap. • Child Health: Labour will digitize the \"Red Book\" record of children’s health and enable vaccinations for babies and children as part of health visits. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Labour healthcare plan seeks to rebuild the NHS by addressing immediate bottlenecks (waiting lists, equipment shortages) while simultaneously implementing deep structural reforms in primary care and social services to create a system that proactively supports lifelong health, rather than just treating illness. This systemic overhaul is like repairing a fractured pipe network: not only fixing the leaks (long waiting lists) but also upgrading the pump station (prevention and primary care) and replacing aging pipes (scanners and outdated systems) to ensure reliable flow for the future.",
          "housing": "The Labour manifesto includes detailed policies aimed at tackling the housing crisis, which it identifies as one of the country’s biggest barriers to growth, under the mission to \"Kickstart Economic Growth\". The overall goal is to \"Get Britain building again\" and make housing more affordable. Here is a summary of the key policies on housing, land use, and renting: 1. Home Building Targets and Planning Reform • 1.5 Million New Homes: Labour aims to build 1.5 million new homes over the next parliament, creating jobs across England. • Restoring Mandatory Housing Targets: Labour will immediately update the National Policy Planning Framework to reverse \"damaging Conservative changes\" and restore mandatory housing targets. • Funding Planning Officers: To support local authorities and ensure Local Plans are up-to-date, Labour will fund additional planning officers. This funding will come from increasing the rate of the stamp duty surcharge paid by non-UK residents. • Intervention Powers: While local communities will continue to shape housebuilding, Labour will not be afraid to make full use of intervention powers where necessary to ensure the needed houses are built. • Strategic Planning: New effective mechanisms for cross-boundary strategic planning will be introduced, requiring all Combined and Mayoral Authorities to strategically plan for housing growth in their areas. Combined Authorities will receive new planning powers and greater freedom over grant funding. 2. Land Use and Green Belt • Brownfield First: Labour will take a \"brownfield first approach,\" prioritizing brownfield land wherever possible and fast-tracking the approval of urban brownfield sites. • Preserving the Green Belt: The party is committed to preserving the green belt. • Strategic Release of Land: While maintaining the general extent and purpose of the green belt, Labour will adopt a more strategic approach to land designation and release for housebuilding needs. The release of lower quality \"grey belt\" land will be prioritised. • Golden Rules: \"Golden rules\" will be introduced to ensure that development benefits communities and nature. • Compulsory Purchase: Labour will reform compulsory purchase compensation rules to improve land assembly, speed up site delivery, and ensure landowners are awarded fair compensation rather than inflated prices based on the prospect of planning permission. • New Towns: In partnership with local leaders and communities, Labour will build a new generation of new towns, alongside urban extensions and regeneration projects, to form a series of large-scale new communities across England. 3. Social and Affordable Housing • Biggest Increase in Social Housing: Labour commits to delivering the biggest increase in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation. • Affordable Homes Programme: Changes will be made to the Affordable Homes Programme to ensure it delivers more homes from existing funding. • Building Capacity: The party will support councils and housing associations to build their capacity and make a greater contribution to affordable housing supply. • Social Rented Homes: Labour will prioritise the building of new social rented homes. • Right to Buy: The manifesto commits to better protecting existing social housing stock by reviewing the increased Right to Buy discounts introduced in 2012 and increasing protections on newly-built social housing. 4. Supporting Buyers and Renters • First-Time Buyers: Labour will work with local authorities to give first-time buyers the first chance to buy homes. They will also end the practice of entire developments being sold off to international investors before houses are even built. • Mortgage Guarantee Scheme: A permanent, comprehensive mortgage guarantee scheme will be introduced to support first-time buyers who struggle to save for a large deposit, aiming for lower mortgage costs. • Private Renters’ Security: Labour will immediately abolish Section 21 \"no-fault\" evictions. They plan to overhaul the regulation of the private rented sector, empowering renters to challenge unreasonable rent increases and extending \"Awaab’s Law\" to the private sector to decisively raise standards. • Ending Leasehold: Labour will take decisive action to finally bring the \"feudal leasehold system to an end\". They will enact Law Commission proposals on leasehold enfranchisement, the right to manage, and commonhold; ban new leasehold flats; ensure commonhold is the default tenure; and tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent charges. They will also address the injustice of \"fleecehold\" private housing estates and unfair maintenance costs. • Building Safety: Labour will take decisive action to improve building safety, including reviewing how to better protect leaseholders from costs and accelerating remediation, while ensuring those responsible for the building safety crisis pay to fix it. • Homelessness: Building on past lessons, Labour will develop a new cross-government strategy to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness. 5. Sustainability and Quality • High-Quality Homes: Labour will ensure the building of more high-quality, well-designed, and sustainable homes and create places that increase climate resilience and promote nature recovery. • Nutrient Neutrality: Solutions will be implemented to unlock the building of homes affected by nutrient neutrality without weakening environmental protections. The commitment to making housing more affordable is central to Labour’s plan to support resilient family finances and tackle the underlying causes of the cost-of-living crisis.",
          "immigration": "The manifesto addresses immigration and border control as one of the Strong Foundations necessary for good government: Secure Borders. The policies focus on ending the chaos in the asylum system, tackling criminal people-smuggling gangs, and managing net migration responsibly. Here is a summary of the key policies on immigration and border security: Secure Borders and Tackling Criminal Gangs Labour characterizes the current situation as \"chaos in the Channel\" fueled by dangerous criminal gangs. • Border Security Command: Labour will stop the chaos by going after the criminal gangs driving the small boats crisis. They will create a new Border Security Command with hundreds of new investigators, intelligence officers, and cross-border police officers. • Funding the Command: The Border Security Command will be funded by ending the \"wasteful\" Migration and Economic Development partnership with Rwanda, which has already cost hundreds of millions of pounds. The sources note that even if the Rwanda scheme got off the ground, it could only address fewer than one per cent of the asylum seekers arriving. • New Powers and Cooperation: The new Command will work internationally and be supported by new counter-terrorism style powers to pursue, disrupt, and arrest those responsible for the \"vile trade\" of people smuggling. Labour will also seek a new security agreement with the EU to ensure access to real-time intelligence and lead joint investigations with European counterparts. Asylum System Reform The goal is to restore order to the asylum system so that it operates swiftly, firmly, and fairly, with rules properly enforced. • Clearing the Backlog: Labour will hire additional caseworkers to clear the Conservatives’ \"perma-backlog\" of tens of thousands of asylum seekers. • Ending Asylum Hotels: Clearing the backlog aims to end the use of asylum hotels, which currently cost the taxpayer millions of pounds every week, thus saving billions of pounds. New measures to clear the backlog are funded by reallocating £155 million annually. • Returns and Enforcement: A new returns and enforcement unit will be established, staffed with an additional 1,000 staff. This unit will be tasked with fast-tracking removals to safe countries for people who do not have the right to stay in the UK. Labour will negotiate additional returns arrangements to speed up removals and increase the number of safe countries failed asylum seekers can swiftly be sent back to. • Addressing Upstream Issues: Labour will also act \"upstream,\" working with international partners to address the humanitarian crises that cause people to flee their homes and strengthen support for refugees in their regions. Managing Legal Migration and Workforce Labour recognizes that people who come to the UK to work make a substantial contribution to the economy, public services, and communities. However, the manifesto notes that the UK economy has become overly dependent on foreign workers to fill skills shortages, leading net migration to reach record highs. • Reducing Net Migration: Labour states that the overall level of migration must be properly controlled and managed, and commits to reducing net migration. This reduction is necessary to avoid reducing incentives for businesses to train locally. • Reforming the Points-Based System: Labour will reform the points-based immigration system to make it fair and properly managed, including appropriate restrictions on visas and linking immigration and skills policy. • Tackling Abuse: Employers and recruitment agencies who abuse the visa system or flout employment law will be barred from hiring workers from abroad. • Joined-Up Policy: Migration decisions to address skills shortages must now trigger a plan to upskill UK workers and improve working conditions in the UK. The manifesto states that the days of a sector languishing endlessly on immigration shortage lists with no action to train up workers will end. • Strengthening Advisory Bodies: Labour will strengthen the Migration Advisory Committee and establish a framework for joint working with skills bodies and the Industrial Strategy Council. • Sectoral Workforce Plans: Labour will end the long-term reliance on overseas workers in certain parts of the economy by bringing in workforce and training plans for sectors such as health and social care, and construction. The approach aims to create a system where legal migration is properly managed and linked to domestic skills training, while forcefully targeting the criminal elements responsible for the small boat crossings.",
          "defence": "The Labour manifesto highlights defense and national security as one of the three Strong Foundations of good government.

          "environment": "The manifesto summarizes its environmental policies under the second National Mission: \"Make Britain a clean energy superpower\", recognizing the climate and nature crisis as the greatest long-term global challenge. The goal is to generate growth, tackle the cost-of-living crisis, and achieve energy independence through a transition to clean energy. The plan emphasizes public investment through the Green Prosperity Plan to leverage private funding, create jobs, cut bills, and accelerate the transition to net zero. 1. Clean Energy and Energy Security The mission is to deliver cheaper, zero-carbon electricity by 2030. • Great British Energy (GBE): A new publicly-owned clean power company called Great British Energy will be created. ◦ GBE will partner with industry and trade unions, co-investing in leading technologies and deploying local energy production. ◦ It will be capitalized with £8.3 billion over the next parliament. ◦ Scotland will be the powerhouse of this mission, and GBE will be headquartered there. • Energy Generation Targets: Labour will work with the private sector to double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. • Fossil Fuels and Windfall Tax: To fund the Green Prosperity Plan, Labour will implement a time-limited windfall tax on oil and gas giants. ◦ This involves extending the sunset clause in the Energy Profits Levy until the end of the next parliament, increasing the rate by three percentage points, and removing generous investment allowances. ◦ Labour will not issue new licences to explore new oil and gas fields because they will not reduce bills, enhance energy security, or prevent the worsening climate crisis. ◦ They will ban fracking for good and will not grant new coal licences. ◦ A phased and responsible transition will be ensured in the North Sea, recognizing the ongoing role of oil and gas in the energy mix and managing existing fields for their lifespan without jeopardizing jobs. • Other Clean Technologies: Labour will invest in carbon capture and storage (£1 billion allocated through the National Wealth Fund), hydrogen (£500 million for green hydrogen manufacturing), and marine energy, and will ensure the UK has the necessary long-term energy storage. • Nuclear Power: Labour will end the \"dithering\" on nuclear power, ensuring the long-term security of the sector by extending the lifetime of existing plants and completing Hinkley Point C. New nuclear power stations, such as Sizewell C, and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) will play an important role. 2. Energy Efficiency and Bills • Warm Homes Plan: Labour will invest an extra £6.6 billion over the next parliament, doubling existing planned government investment, to upgrade five million homes to cut bills for families. This program is costed at an annual average of £1.1 billion. ◦ The plan will offer grants and low-interest loans for insulation, solar panels, batteries, and low-carbon heating. ◦ Homes in the private rented sector must meet minimum energy efficiency standards by 2030. • No Forced Boiler Rip-Outs: The manifesto assures that nobody will be forced to rip out their boiler as a result of these plans. • Grid Modernization: The national grid is recognized as the biggest obstacle to deploying cheap, clean power. Labour will work with industry to upgrade national transmission infrastructure and rewire Britain. • Energy Regulation: Labour will ensure a tougher system of regulation that puts consumers first. They will work with the regulator to reduce standing charges on bills, hold companies accountable for wrongdoing, block executive bonuses for polluters, and impose automatic customer compensation for failure. 3. Nature, Water, and Pollution • Cleaning up Water: Labour will put failing water companies under special measures to clean up our water. ◦ Regulators will be given new powers to block bonuses to executives who pollute waterways and bring criminal charges against persistent law breakers. ◦ Automatic and severe fines will be imposed for wrongdoing, and there will be independent monitoring of every outlet. • Protecting Nature and Biodiversity: Labour will deliver for nature and work to meet Environment Act targets. ◦ New habitats will be expanded, including wetlands, peat bogs, and forests. ◦ They will create nine new National River Walks and establish three new National Forests in England. • Circular Economy: Labour is committed to reducing waste by moving to a circular economy. • Addressing Flooding and Erosion: Labour will improve resilience and preparation across various stakeholders (government, local authorities, emergency services) to adapt to risks posed by flooding and coastal erosion. 4. Climate Governance and Finance • Institutional Framework: Labour will ensure the institutional framework for policy making reflects commitments to reach net zero and carbon budgets. • Bank of England Mandate: The Conservative decision to prevent the Bank of England from giving due consideration to climate change in its mandates will be reversed. • Green Finance: Labour aims to make the UK the green finance capital of the world by mandating UK-regulated financial institutions (including banks, asset managers, and pension funds) and FTSE 100 companies to develop and implement credible transition plans aligned with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement. • International Leadership: Labour will restore strong global leadership on climate action. They will create a new Clean Power Alliance, a coalition of countries at the cutting edge of climate action, to accelerate the energy transition and enhance clean energy supply chains. • Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM): Labour supports the introduction of a CBAM to protect British industries as the UK decarbonizes, prevent the dumping of lower-quality goods, and support climate objectives. This environmental strategy is fundamentally tied to economic growth, using investment in clean power as a mechanism to create jobs, reduce household costs, and regain international influence.",
          "brexit": "The sources address the party’s position on Brexit within the context of rebuilding relationships internationally and being \"confident in our status outside of the EU\".

They will strengthen the structures of intergovernmental working to improve collaboration on policy. • Windsor Framework: Labour is committed to implementing the Windsor Framework in good faith and protecting the UK internal market, which is vital for Northern Ireland’s stability and economy. In essence, Labour’s policy on Brexit is to accept the decision to leave the EU as final, commit to major \"red lines\" (no single market, customs union, or freedom of movement), and focus instead on pragmatic, sector-specific agreements (like a veterinary agreement) and security pacts to manage the relationship and reduce economic friction.",

          "crime": "The key policies of the Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024 concerning crime and justice are detailed under the section titled \"Our plan for safer streets and justice for victims of crime\". The plan emphasizes increasing police presence, implementing tougher sentencing, and supporting victims. Here is a summary of the manifesto’s key policies on crime: 1.

          "immigration": "The Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024 sets out a clear plan for controlling both illegal migration and the overall level of legal migration, emphasizing securing the borders and reducing the impact on public services. The key policies on immigration and border security are summarized under the plan titled \"Our plan to control immigration and stop illegal immigration\". 1. Stopping Illegal Immigration (Stopping the Boats) The central focus is establishing a strong deterrent to illegal channel crossings: • Establishing a Deterrent (Rwanda): The party pledges to run a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda. They plan to start regular flights every month this July, continuing until the boats are stopped. • Prioritizing Security over Foreign Courts: They assert that if they are forced to choose between the UK’s security and the jurisdiction of a foreign court, including the ECtHR, they will always choose security. • Ending the Legal Merry-Go-Round: They will stop illegal migrants from bringing \"spurious challenges\" to block their removal by bringing the Illegal Migration Act into force. • Asylum Backlog: They aim to clear the asylum backlog, with a target for all claims to be processed in six months, and promise to end the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. • Organized Crime: They will crack down on organized immigration crime, utilizing the National Crime Agency and intelligence services to disrupt supply chains and tackle people smugglers. • Returns Deals: They commit to signing further returns deals, building on the one already agreed with Albania. • Reforming Asylum Rules: The party will hold an international summit and work with other countries to reform international laws to make them \"fit for an age of mass migration\". They will also restrict visa access from countries that do not cooperate on national priorities like illegal migration. • Safe and Legal Routes: With control of the borders, they promise to give Parliament control over how many places are offered on safe and legal routes (for refugees fleeing persecution), setting a cap based on the capacity of local areas. This is in addition to maintaining existing visa schemes for people fleeing Hong Kong, Ukraine, and their Afghan settlement schemes. 2. Controlling Legal Migration The manifesto acknowledges that immigration is currently too high and must be brought down to sustainable levels to reduce strain on public services and housing, and to restore public confidence. • Legal Cap: They will introduce a binding, legal cap on migration. This cap will be set on both work and family visas. • Falling Numbers: The cap will be set at a level that explicitly takes into account the costs and benefits of migration. Crucially, the cap is guaranteed to fall every year of the next Parliament and cannot be breached. • Parliamentary Vote: Parliament will have an annual vote on the level of the cap to ensure public confidence in immigration control. • Maintaining Existing Reforms: They note that changes already implemented mean 300,000 people who were previously eligible to come to the UK now could not. These changes include: ◦ Ending the ability of almost all international students and all care workers to bring dependents. ◦ Abolishing the 20% going rate salary discount for shortage occupations. ◦ Increasing the salary threshold for Skilled Worker visas by 48% to £38,700. ◦ Raising the minimum income for family visas to £38,700. • Inflation Link: Going forward, they will automatically raise the Skilled Worker threshold and Family income requirement with inflation to ensure they do not undercut UK workers. • No Free Movement: They explicitly state they \"won’t allow any form of free movement to return\". 3. Financial and Health Requirements for Migrants Policies are aimed at ensuring migrants do not become a burden on the NHS: • Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS): They previously required migrants to pay the IHS and increased it to £1,035. They plan to go further by: ◦ Removing the student discount to the IHS. ◦ Increasing all visa fees. ◦ Requiring migrants to undergo a health check in advance of travel. ◦ Increasing their IHS or requiring them to buy health insurance if they are likely to be a burden on the NHS. In essence, the manifesto treats immigration as a security and capacity issue, proposing a dual strategy: aggressive removal of illegal migrants to Rwanda and strict quantitative limits on legal migration through a binding, annual, legal cap.",

Under the Pensions Tax Guarantee, they will not introduce any new taxes on pensions, maintaining the 25% tax-free lump sum and tax relief on contributions. • Child Benefit Reform: To address unfairness, they will move the withdrawal of Child Benefit to a household income basis, setting the combined household income threshold at £120,000. 2. Debt, Borrowing, and Welfare Reform The plan emphasizes maintaining fiscal stability and reforming welfare to reduce spending: • Fiscal Rules: They will continue to meet the fiscal rules of ensuring public sector net debt is falling and that public sector net borrowing is below 3% of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast.

Supporting Farmers and Rural Life Policies also focus on supporting the rural economy and food security : • Food Security Target: They will introduce a legally binding target to enhance the UK-wide food security. • Agricultural Funding: They will increase the UK-wide farming budget by £1 billion over the Parliament, ensuring it rises by inflation every year. • Flood Defences: They will maintain record flooding funding to continue protecting homes, farms, and businesses. In summary, the party frames its environmental policies as a \"pragmatic\" pursuit of Net Zero by investing heavily in nuclear and domestic energy sources, ensuring energy bills are kept low, while simultaneously protecting agricultural land and tackling water pollution. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Analogy: The Conservative approach to the environment and energy is like managing a car journey with the goal of reaching a sustainable destination (Net Zero by 2050) while ensuring the family budget isn’t ruined and the tank never runs dry. They rely on \"home-grown fuel\" (North Sea oil, gas, and nuclear power) to keep the engine running reliably today, even while investing in \"cleaner tech\" (offshore wind and SMRs) for tomorrow. Crucially, they refuse to install expensive new components (green levies or forced heat pumps) unless they are confident the family can afford it, favoring gradual upgrades and cost-conscious planning.",
          "brexit": "The Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024 frames its approach to Brexit as a means to seize opportunities, solidify the UK’s sovereignty, and drive economic benefits through new trade relationships and regulatory reforms. Here is a summary of the key policies on Brexit, drawing directly from the sources: 1. Seizing the Benefits and Economic Freedoms The party commits to leveraging post-Brexit freedoms to boost the economy and cut red tape: • Trade Deals: They plan to seize the benefits of Brexit by signing further trade deals. They aim to complete Free Trade Agreements with India and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which is home to some of the world’s biggest investors. They will also continue to pursue agreements with countries such as Israel and Switzerland. • Infrastructure and Housing: Brexit freedoms will be used to speed up infrastructure and unblock 100,000 homes. Specifically, they plan to abolish the legacy EU \"nutrient neutrality\" rules to immediately unlock 100,000 new homes. • Cutting Red Tape: They aim to cut red tape for business. They have already repealed or reformed over 2,000 EU laws and plan to have repealed or reformed over half of the entire stock of EU law inherited by July 2026. Their \"Smarter Regulation approach\" is projected to have already saved businesses an estimated £1 billion and 50 million hours of administrative time. • Tax Freedoms: Post-Brexit tax freedoms have been used, including introducing VAT-free installations of energy-efficient materials and replacing complex EU alcohol duty rates. They will also maintain the Brexit Pubs Guarantee that ensures the duty on draught drinks (like beer and cider) is less than in supermarkets. • Speeding up Infrastructure Planning: They will introduce reforms to outdated EU red tape to better protect nature while enabling the building of new homes, prisons, and energy schemes, speeding up local and national infrastructure planning systems. 2. EU Relationship and Sovereignty The manifesto clearly defines the limits of any future relationship or review of the current agreement with the EU: • Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) Review: While they will build on the TCA, they state they \"will not agree to anything in the forthcoming review of the TCA that would infringe our legal sovereignty or involve submission to the CJEU or dynamic alignment\". • Standing Up to the EU: They promise to take a tough approach to ensure the EU meets its commitments under the TCA and does not discriminate against UK exporters. • No Free Movement: They explicitly commit to not allowing \"any form of free movement to return\". • Public Services Protection: They are clear that the NHS and the services it provides \"are not on the table in trade negotiations\". 3. Strengthening the Union (Northern Ireland) The manifesto addresses the need to secure Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market post-Brexit: • Windsor Framework: They commit to faithfully implementing all commitments in the Windsor Framework and the Safeguarding the Union Command Paper. • Unfettered Access: The Framework is credited with addressing fundamental problems with the old Protocol and providing Northern Ireland with unique advantages, including guaranteed unfettered access to the UK internal market and privileged access to the EU Single Market for goods. • No Checks (GB to NI): Goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that will only ever stay in the UK are subject to \"no checks\", except for risk-based checks conducted by UK authorities to tackle criminality, abuse, smuggling, and disease risks. • Intertrade UK: They will establish a new Intertrade UK body to promote trade within the United Kingdom. • Internal Market Protection: They will relentlessly protect the UK’s internal market to secure Northern Ireland’s place in it and protect consumers and businesses from unnecessary trade barriers. 4. Fisheries and Agriculture Specific sectors benefiting from leaving the EU are also prioritized: • Fishing Sector: They will continue to back the fishing sector after taking back control of UK waters post-Brexit. They aim to seek additional opportunities for the inshore fleet in the 2026 negotiations. • Agricultural Standards: All imported food and drink products, including those from countries with which the UK has trade agreements, must comply with the UK’s high standards. In short, the manifesto views Brexit as a successful completed project that has delivered a record of achievement, including securing major new trade and security deals , and enabling the UK to become the fourth biggest exporter in the world. The future policy focus is on maximizing the economic and sovereign advantages gained through leaving the EU.",
          "entire manifesto": "The Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024, titled \"Clear Plan Bold Action Secure Future\", outlines a comprehensive plan spanning economic, social, and security policies, with an emphasis on achieving a secure future for the nation and families by sticking to a clear plan. The key policy proposals are structured around several core plans: 1. Economy, Taxes, and Pensions The party pledges to continue efforts to stabilize the economy after challenges like Covid and the Ukraine conflict, noting that inflation is down, and growth has returned. Key fiscal policies include: • Tax Cuts for Workers: A plan to cut employee National Insurance by another 2p, aiming to halve it from 12% at the beginning of the year to 6% by April 2027. This is part of a long-term ambition to end the double tax on work. • Self-Employed Taxes: Abolish the main rate of self-employed National Insurance entirely by the end of the next Parliament. This builds on the abolition of Class 2 contributions and benefits 93% of self-employed people. • Pensions Protection: Introduce the new Triple Lock Plus, guaranteeing that both the State Pension and the tax-free allowance for pensioners always rise with the highest of inflation, earnings, or 2.5%. This ensures the new State Pension is not dragged into income tax. • Business Taxes: They commit to not raising corporation tax or Capital Gains Tax and will maintain R&D tax reliefs. They also commit to not raising the rate of income tax or VAT. • Debt Management: Continue to meet fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling and public sector net borrowing below 3% of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast. 2. National Security and Immigration Control The manifesto stresses securing the nation from global uncertainty and controlling borders. • Defence Spending: Boost defence spending to the new NATO standard of 2.5% of GDP by 2030. • Stopping Illegal Migration: Establish a deterrent by running a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda, with regular flights starting this July. They will bring the Illegal Migration Act into force and aim to clear the asylum backlog, ending the use of hotels. • Legal Migration Cap: Introduce a binding, legal cap on migration (covering work and family visas) to guarantee that numbers fall every year, while still allowing the intake of skills needed by businesses and the NHS. Parliament will have an annual vote on the level of the cap. 3. Health and Social Care The plan focuses on increasing capacity, productivity, and shifting care closer to patients. • Funding and Staffing: Increase NHS spending above inflation every year. Recruit 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors by the end of the next Parliament. • Service Delivery: Expand Pharmacy First (including for menopause support, contraception, and chest infections), which is expected to free up 20 million GP appointments annually. They plan to build or modernize 250 GP surgeries and build 50 more Community Diagnostic Centres. • Technology: Invest £3.4 billion in new technology to transform the NHS, including using the NHS App as the single front door for services and using AI to free up clinician time. • Social Care: Implement planned reforms to cap social care costs from October 2025. 4. Families, Education, and Youth Opportunities Policies aim to support families, improve childcare, and enhance opportunities for young people. • Childcare: Deliver 30 hours of free childcare a week for working parents, from when their child is nine months old until they start school (full rollout by September 2025), saving eligible families an average of £6,900 per year. • Child Benefit Reform: End the unfairness in the Child Benefit system by moving to a household income basis for withdrawal, setting the combined household income threshold at £120,000. • National Service: Introduce mandatory National Service for all 18-year-old school leavers, offering a choice between a year-long competitive military placement or 25 days a year of civic service. • Education and Skills: Fund 100,000 high-quality apprenticeships for young people, paid for by curbing the number of poor-quality university degrees. Introduce the Advanced British Standard to transform 16-19 education. Require schools to ban the use of mobile phones during the school day. 5. Housing and Infrastructure The plan commits to building homes, supporting first-time buyers, and prioritizing local transport. • Housing Targets: Deliver 1.6 million homes in England in the next Parliament. • First-Time Buyers Support: Permanently abolish Stamp Duty for homes up to £425,000 for first-time buyers. Introduce a new Help to Buy scheme offering an equity loan of up to 20% on new build homes. • Planning Reform: Abolish legacy EU \"nutrient neutrality\" rules to immediately unlock 100,000 new homes. Commit to protecting the Green Belt. • Local Transport Investment: Invest £36 billion saved from cancelling the second phase of HS2 into local roads, rail, and buses. This includes a record £8.3 billion to fill potholes and resurface roads. • Backing Drivers Bill: Introduce legislation to stop road pricing, reverse the London Mayor’s ULEZ expansion, and require local referendums for new 20mph zones and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods. 6. Energy and Net Zero The party seeks an affordable and pragmatic path to net zero by 2050. • Energy Security: Legislate to ensure annual licensing rounds for North Sea oil and gas production. Scale up nuclear power, approving two new fleets of Small Modular Reactors within the first 100 days. • Cost Control: Guarantee no new green levies or charges and ensure green levies on household bills are lower than they were in 2023. • Efficiency: Invest £6 billion in energy efficiency over the next three years to make around a million homes warmer. 7. Safer Streets and Justice Policies are aimed at recruiting more police and imposing tougher sentencing. • Policing: Recruit 8,000 more full-time, fully warranted police officers dedicated to neighbourhood policing. • Anti-Social Behaviour: Roll out Hotspot Policing to cut anti-social behaviour. Legislatively ensure social tenants who repeatedly disrupt neighbours can be evicted. • Sentencing: Toughen sentencing for the worst offenders, including making life imprisonment without parole mandatory for more heinous murderers and requiring rapists and other serious sexual offenders to spend the whole of their sentences behind bars. • Counter-Terrorism: Urgently introduce Martyn’s Law to ensure premises are better prepared for terrorist attacks. 8. Welfare Reform The plan seeks to make the welfare system fairer and more sustainable, aiming to save taxpayers £12 billion a year. • Disability Benefits: Reform disability benefits, such as PIP assessments, to better target genuine needs and consider whether treatment or services, rather than a monthly cash payment, might be more appropriate for some mental health conditions. • Work Capability: Tighten up how the benefits system assesses capability for work from September 2025, ensuring those with moderate issues are given tailored support to engage with the world of work. • Sanctions: Introduce tougher sanctions so people who refuse to take up suitable jobs after 12 months on benefits can have their cases closed and their benefits removed entirely. Analogy The Conservative manifesto presents itself like a household financial plan: it focuses on cutting expenses (taxes and green levies), investing heavily in non-negotiable insurance (defence and NHS staffing), and strictly vetting who gets to live there (controlling immigration), all while aiming to quickly build enough infrastructure (1.6 million homes and local roads) to support its current residents."

        {
          "crime": "The SNP manifesto focuses on a few key areas related to crime, justice, and security, primarily through a public health lens for the drug crisis and in relation to international cooperation and safety measures. Here is a summary of the key policies on crime and justice: Drug Death Crisis and Public Health • The SNP plans to tackle the drug death crisis by adopting a radical public health approach. • This approach includes decriminalizing drugs for personal use. • The party will introduce a framework to allow Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities. • They also call for the devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament to allow them to go further in reducing harm and improving lives in Scotland. International Justice and Security • The sources note that Brexit resulted in the loss of access to one of the world’s most sophisticated and integrated international justice and crime-fighting ecosystems. • Rejoining the EU would lead to a safer Scotland by allowing the country to work closely with police in the EU to help fight cross-border crime, serious organised crime, cyber crime, and terrorism. Domestic Safety and Security • The SNP MPs will press the UK Government to introduce \"Martyn’s Law\" without delay to ensure venues and councils have preventative plans in place against terror attacks. • They will also push the UK Government to focus on countering disinformation and misinformation and better protecting national critical infrastructure. • The party emphasizes the protection of people, particularly children, by ensuring the Online Safety Act comes into force on time. SNP MPs will press the UK Government to ensure tech firms cannot escape their responsibilities for the content on their platforms through full enforcement of the Act and prompt strengthening of these laws when required. Justice for Victims • The manifesto demands that the UK Government deliver justice for Post Office Horizon victims, ensuring compensation is paid at pace to all sub postmasters who suffered miscarriages of justice. The party specifies that the vast majority of payments should be made by the end of 2024. • They also pledge to work with the UK Government to provide justice for Infected Blood victims, ensuring any compensation scheme works effectively for everyone infected or affected and is delivered without delay. Funding Emergency Services • The SNP will call on the UK Government to refund the £175 million in VAT owed to Scotland’s emergency services so that this money can be invested in vital emergency services. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The SNP’s approach to the drug death crisis is akin to treating a complex illness—like a chronic condition requiring specialized medical care—rather than simply applying a punitive punishment. By advocating for decriminalization and Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities, the party aims to shift the focus from criminal justice to public health, mirroring strategies used successfully in certain medical interventions.",
          "healthcare": "The SNP manifesto emphasizes the protection and enhancement of Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS), positioning independence as the ultimate means to secure its future funding and operation. Here is a summary of the SNP’s key policies on healthcare and related public health matters: Protecting and Funding the NHS • Protecting the NHS from Privatization: SNP MPs will demand that the UK Government protect the NHS from Westminster privatization through their proposed \"Keep the NHS in Public Hands\" Bill. This Bill aims to ensure the health service remains a publicly owned and operated service and would prevent any UK government from undermining the NHS principles and protections as part of any future trade deals. • Increased UK Funding Demand: The SNP will demand significant financial investment from the UK Government into NHS England, which would subsequently boost the Scottish NHS budget via the Barnett formula. ◦ They call for a minimum £10 billion extra each year to address inflationary pressures and improve performance, which would generate an additional £1 billion annually for NHS Scotland. ◦ They demand the UK Government match Scotland’s NHS pay deals by increasing investment in NHS England staff pay and conditions by at least £6 billion. This would deliver around £600 million for Scotland to invest in pay deals for hardworking NHS staff. ◦ Combined, these funding increases would generate a £1.6 billion annual funding boost for Scotland’s NHS. • Reversing Capital Cuts: The party demands the reversal of the £1.3 billion cut to Scotland’s capital budget, which pays for hospitals, roads, and schools, enabling investment in new hospitals. • Current Performance and Investment: The SNP notes that funding for Scotland’s NHS has more than doubled under their administration, and NHS staffing is at a record high, with far more doctors and nurses per head in Scotland than in England. The SNP Scottish Government is determined to go further, including investing £300 million to drive down waiting times, despite constraints imposed by Westminster. Addressing Workforce Shortages • Standing up for the Workforce: SNP MPs will call for the reversal of the recent decision by the Conservatives to stop care workers from overseas bringing their families with them to the UK. This is due to concerns that these vital workers are necessary to prevent increased shortages and suffering among the most vulnerable. • Impact of Brexit: The manifesto highlights that the end of freedom of movement due to Brexit has made it much harder to recruit staff to work in the NHS, social care, and other vital sectors. Public Health and Social Care • Tackling the Drug Deaths Crisis: The SNP will take a radical public health approach to the drug deaths crisis. This includes advocating for the devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament to reduce harm and improve lives. Specifically, they would decriminalize drugs for personal use and introduce a framework to allow Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities. • Abortion and Healthcare: The SNP is clear that all women should have access to abortion services safely and timely. They urge the UK Government to follow Scotland’s lead in reviewing the law on abortion to ensure it is treated primarily as a healthcare matter. • Smoking and Gambling: The manifesto calls for the reintroduction of UK-wide legislation to create a smoke free generation and a recommitment to banning single-use vapes, following the lead of the SNP Scottish Government. They also believe that problem gambling should be treated as a public health matter and call for the urgent introduction of a Gambling Levy. • Free Services: The SNP Scottish Government has supported households by protecting free prescriptions, personal care, and eye tests for all. • Infected Blood Victims: The SNP will work with the UK Government to ensure any compensation scheme for victims of infected blood works effectively for everyone infected or affected and is delivered without delay. Addressing Austerity and Westminster Decisions The overall context for the NHS policies is the party’s belief that the NHS faces twin threats of Westminster privatization and austerity. They argue that independence is the means to address concerns over the funding of the NHS by building a stronger economy. Until independence, SNP MPs will work to protect Scotland’s NHS and oppose further austerity imposed by Westminster.",
          "housing": "The SNP manifesto details several policies related to housing, focusing on mitigating the cost of living crisis, increasing affordable housing stock, and reversing Westminster cuts that impact infrastructure investment. Here is a summary of the key policies on housing: Addressing the Housing Emergency and Cost of Living • Tackling the Housing Emergency: The SNP identifies a housing emergency caused by decades of Westminster underinvestment, the consequences of a hard Brexit, and a £1.3 billion cut to the Scottish Government’s capital budget from the UK Government. • Reversing Capital Budget Cuts: The party demands that the UK Government restore the cut to the Scottish Capital Budget to help tackle the housing emergency. Investment and Construction • Affordable Housing Delivery: The SNP Scottish Government reports that it has already delivered over 128,000 affordable homes. Furthermore, the sources state that the SNP Scottish Government has built 40% more affordable homes per head than in England, and over 70% more than in Wales. • Construction VAT Reform: The SNP advocates for the reform of VAT to address the imbalance in VAT rates in the construction sector. This is intended to encourage the refurbishment and retrofitting of existing buildings. • RAAC Remediation Fund: The manifesto calls for the introduction of a RAAC Remediation Fund to make new capital money available. This fund would allow necessary action to be taken to tackle the problem of ageing Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC) in the public sector. Rent and Housing Support • Mitigation of UK Policies: The SNP Scottish Government has taken actions within its limited powers, including supporting people with housing costs and introducing temporary rent cap controls. • Bedroom Tax: The SNP Scottish Government has mitigated the UK Government’s bedroom tax in full. SNP MPs will continue to call on the UK Government to scrap the cruel bedroom tax which penalizes people claiming Universal Credit or housing benefit if they have a spare room in their rented council or housing association home. • Local Housing Allowance (LHA): SNP MPs at Westminster will push for an annual uplift of the Local Housing Allowance, while ensuring rental costs are adequately taken into account. • Devolution of Housing Support: The party demands the devolution of Housing Benefit and Local Housing Allowance. This would allow the Scottish Government to adopt an innovative approach to tackling child poverty, expanding the delivery of social housing, and helping to fund and encourage investment in house building. Helping First-Time Buyers • Help to Buy ISA: The SNP proposes to reintroduce a simplified Help to Buy ISA scheme to assist first-time buyers. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In essence, the SNP views housing provision as a priority that is currently being hampered by Westminster cuts to capital funding and by restrictive welfare policies like the bedroom tax. They aim to secure greater investment and devolved powers (like control over Housing Benefit) to enhance their ability to build affordable homes and better support tenants.",
          "immigration": "The SNP manifesto outlines several key policies concerning immigration, focusing on mitigating the negative effects of Brexit and demanding the devolution of powers to allow Scotland to implement a tailored migration system. Here is a summary of the policies on immigration: Devolution and Bespoke Migration System • The SNP demands the devolution of powers to create a bespoke migration system for Scotland. • This bespoke system would value those who choose to work, live, study, and invest in Scotland. • The goal of devolution is to allow Scotland to address its specific demographic and economic needs. • Until full devolution of immigration powers is achieved, including overseas workers’ employment visas, the UK Government must acknowledge the distinct demographic challenges Scotland faces. Addressing Labour Shortages and Brexit Impacts • The end of freedom of movement due to Brexit has made it much harder to recruit staff to work in the NHS, social care, and other vital sectors. • The SNP will push the UK Government to mitigate the harm of Brexit on productivity by reviewing immigration rules and expanding shortage occupation lists, ensuring businesses have access to the workforce they need. • Rural Visa Pilot Scheme: The party urges the UK Government to introduce a rural visa pilot scheme to mitigate against labour shortages caused by a hard Brexit and hostile immigration policies. • Care Workers: SNP MPs will call for the reversal of the recent decision by the Conservatives to stop care workers from overseas bringing their families with them to work in the UK, as these workers are vital to prevent increased shortages and suffering among the most vulnerable. Asylum and Refugee Policy • The SNP will scrap the morally repugnant Rwanda scheme. • The party will continue to strongly oppose the policy of no recourse to public funds. • SNP MPs will urge the UK Government to grant asylum seekers the right to work. • They also call for a fundamental change in the approach to housing asylum seekers, ensuring that accommodation is safe, suitable, and dignified. • The party supports extending the eligibility to vote to all residents, including international students and those with refugee status, as is the case in Scotland. International Cooperation and Free Movement • The SNP aims to rejoin the EU and reverse the damage of Brexit, which includes restoring free movement for EU citizens. • Rejoining the EU would deliver freedom of movement to live, visit, study, and work freely in any EU country. • It would also provide access to workers from across the EU, enabling many of Scotland’s industries to grow. • The SNP urges the UK Government to agree to an EU-wide youth mobility scheme, which both the Conservatives and Labour have previously rejected, to provide young people with opportunities to live, work, and study in the EU.",
          "defence": "The SNP’s policies regarding defence, as outlined in the sources, focus primarily on nuclear disarmament, investment in conventional forces and public services, and specific provisions for armed forces personnel and veterans. Key defence and security policies include: Nuclear Disarmament and Conventional Defence Funding • The SNP’s stance is to Scrap Trident (the UK’s nuclear deterrent). • They oppose the retention or renewal of Trident. • They will press the UK government to meet its international obligations on nuclear disarmament. • The billions spent funding these \"immoral weapons\" should be invested instead into adequately funding conventional defence and public services, such as the NHS and schools. Armed Forces and Personnel • The SNP will urge the UK Government to raise the military recruitment age to 18, phasing out the recruitment of people under 18 in line with international standards. • They prioritize the needs of the Armed Forces and Veterans community. • They have long campaigned for an Armed Forces Representative Body to accommodate the wide range of needs, concerns, and identities within the Forces Community. • They believe it is vital that the UK Government prioritize employment, social inclusion, health and wellbeing for veterans and their families. • Following the approach of the SNP Scottish Government, they support veterans by ensuring the War Disablement Pension is exempt from the assessment of income for veterans who require social care services. International Affairs and Security • The SNP seeks to strengthen Scotland’s security by pushing the UK to focus on countering disinformation and misinformation. • They also advocate for better protecting national critical infrastructure, improving supply chain resilience, and strengthening the UK’s ability to rebound from a shock or crisis. • They will press the UK Government to ensure \"Martyn’s Law\" is introduced without delay to ensure venues and councils have preventative plans in place against terror attacks. Regarding specific international conflicts: • Ukraine: The SNP continues to strongly oppose the Russian invasion. They will continue to back military support from the United Kingdom to Ukraine and press the UK Government to ensure the sanctions regime against Russia is effective. • Gaza/Israel: They demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and ending arms sales to Israel. They call on the UK Government to immediately recognise Palestine as an independent state, viewing this as the only path toward a just and durable long-term peace.",
          "economy": "The SNP manifesto frames its economic policies around achieving independence, reversing austerity, mitigating the damage caused by Brexit, and promoting investment in a fairer, greener economy. The core belief is that the Westminster economic system is broken and has failed the people of Scotland. Here is a summary of the SNP’s key economic policies: Independence, Brexit, and Economic Control • Core Goal: Independence is the vital necessity and means of addressing economic concerns, including the cost of living and funding for the NHS. With independence, all key decisions over the economy, taxes, and spending will transfer from Westminster to Scotland. • Failed UK Economy: The UK economy is described as broken, having delivered stagnant wages and low living standards compared with similar countries. Independent countries comparable to Scotland (like Denmark, Sweden, and Ireland) have used the decision-making powers of independence to achieve higher national income per head, lower inequality, higher productivity, and lower levels of poverty. • Reversing Brexit Damage: Brexit is viewed as an economic disaster that has wiped billions of pounds from the Scottish economy, pushed up prices on food and services, and worsened the cost of living crisis. ◦ The SNP aims to rejoin the EU and re-enter the single market, restoring free movement for EU citizens. ◦ Rejoining the EU would deliver cheaper and quicker trading for businesses and provide access to workers from across the EU, enabling many industries to grow. Ending Austerity and Public Spending • Ending Austerity: The SNP will deliver independence to strengthen the economy and end 14 years of austerity, reversing deep damaging cuts to public services. They will stand against the Westminster consensus on continued cuts. • Demanding Increased Investment: The party demands that the UK Government bring forward an immediate emergency budget after the election to reverse public spending cuts and deliver meaningful investment in economic growth. • Mitigating Cuts: The SNP notes that the Scottish Government has done all it can to mitigate the \"callous cuts\" imposed by Westminster, but is constrained by limited economic and financial levers. Fiscal Rules and Infrastructure Investment • Reversing Capital Cuts: The manifesto demands the UK Government reverse the £1.3 billion cut to the Scottish capital budget. This cut, coupled with high inflation, places unprecedented pressure on the infrastructure budget and has restricted the growth of the Scottish economy. ◦ Restoring this money is vital to invest in new hospitals, schools, rail, and road infrastructure, and to help achieve net zero. • Scrapping and Implementing New Fiscal Rules: The SNP calls on the UK Government to scrap its current fiscal rules that \"choke off borrowing for investment\". • Proposed New Fiscal Rules: The party proposes sensible alternative fiscal rules to enable increased capital investment: 1. A Public Sector Net Worth rule, recognizing the value of investing in infrastructure and public sector assets. 2. An Upper limit on debt servicing costs, to allow explicit consideration of the sustainability of the stock of debt. 3. Three-year detailed spending plans, to improve clarity for devolved administrations. Taxation Policy • Devolution of Tax Powers: The SNP demands the full devolution of tax powers to enable the creation of a fairer system that protects public services and invests in the economy. • Progressive Tax System: The SNP Scottish Government reports delivering the fairest and most progressive income tax system in the UK, raising an additional £1.5 billion to invest in public services. • Specific Devolution Demands: ◦ Devolution of National Insurance so that rates and thresholds fit Scotland’s progressive income tax rates. ◦ Devolution of windfall taxation for companies operating in Scotland to tackle the cost of living and climate crises. ◦ Devolution of road tax and fuel duty to develop a new approach to funding road travel. • Tax Reform: The SNP supports the reform of VAT to address current imbalances. Specific proposals include: ◦ Introducing a lower rate of VAT for hospitality and tourism sectors to drive economic growth. ◦ Addressing the imbalance in VAT rates in the construction sector to encourage the refurbishment and retrofitting of existing buildings. ◦ Removing VAT from on-street electric vehicle charging. ◦ Ending the VAT exemption for private schools (with full powers). Cost of Living and Welfare The SNP aims to tackle the cost of living crisis and improve living standards. Key actions include: • Essentials Guarantee: Legislate for an essentials guarantee to ensure everyone can afford basic necessities like food and utilities. • Benefit Caps: Scrap the two child benefit cap and the associated rape clause. • Support for Workers: Scrap exploitative zero hours contracts and ban callous \"fire and rehire\" practices. • Energy Costs: Press for a significant cut in standing charges for all and removal of standing charges for anyone with a prepayment meter. Green Economy and Energy • Green Economy Investment: The SNP demands the UK Government invest at least £28 billion a year in the green economy to deliver a step change in public and private investment. • Just Transition: Demand that the new UK Government match Scotland’s £500 million Just Transition Fund for the North East and Moray. • Energy Devolution: Demand the devolution of powers over energy regulation, pricing, and production to fully harness Scotland’s vast renewable energy sources and ensure they best serve the needs of the Scottish people. • Oil and Gas: Decisions on new oil and gas licenses must be made on a rigorously evidence-led, case-by-case basis, consistent with climate obligations and energy security considerations, through a robust climate compatibility assessment. • Grangemouth: Stress the need for the UK Government to invest in a sustainable future for the Grangemouth complex, recognizing its importance to Scotland’s economy and retaining the skilled workforce during the transition.",
          "education": "The SNP manifesto contains specific policies regarding education, primarily focusing on maintaining the current system in Scotland and leveraging EU cooperation for future generations. Here is a summary of the key policies on education: Defending Free Education • The SNP is the only party that will defend free university tuition in Scotland. • Protecting free education means that graduates in Scotland are thousands of pounds better off. Investment and Resources • The party demands the reversal of the £1.3 billion cut Westminster imposed on Scotland’s capital budget, which pays for schools, hospitals, and rail infrastructure. • The SNP will scrap Trident and invest the money into public services, including schools. • The SNP Scottish Government has extended free school meal provision and cancelled school meal debt. • The Scottish Government has also expanded free childcare, which is reported to save families £5,500 annually. International Opportunities (Rejoining the EU) • Rejoining the EU would lead to re-entry to the Erasmus+ scheme, which would widen educational opportunities for Scotland’s future generations. • The SNP urges the UK Government to agree to an EU-wide youth mobility scheme so that young people can benefit from the opportunities that living, working, and studying in the EU can bring. Democratic Access to Education • The SNP supports extending the eligibility to vote to all residents, including all international students, as is the case in Scotland.",
          "environment": "The SNP manifesto presents several policies focused on the environment, climate change, and the transition to a greener economy, often linking these goals to the benefits of independence and devolved powers. Here is a summary of the key policies on the environment: Climate Goals and Funding • Climate Ambition: The SNP’s commitment to tackling the twin crises of climate change and nature loss is unwavering, and they believe emissions reduction and economic prosperity go hand in hand. • Net Zero Target: Scotland must reach net zero by 2045 for the whole of the UK to reach net zero by 2050. • Green Economy Investment: The SNP demands that the UK Government invest at least £28 billion a year in the green economy to deliver a step change in public and private investment in net zero and major investment in the domestic supply chain. • Reversing Capital Cuts: The party demands the reversal of the £1.3 billion cut to the Scottish capital budget to enable investment in infrastructure and help to achieve net zero. Energy Policy and Devolution • Devolution of Powers: The SNP demands the devolution of powers over energy regulation, pricing, and production to fully harness Scotland’s vast renewable energy sources and ensure they best serve the needs of the Scottish people. ◦ With full powers, they could make changes to the electricity grid system, including reducing fees for Scottish producers to connect, which currently holds back renewable energy development. • Renewable Energy Focus: The SNP believes the best pathway to net zero and secure, affordable, and clean energy is through significant growth in renewables, storage, hydrogen, and carbon capture. • New Nuclear Power: The party will rule out new nuclear power plants in Scotland. • Hydrogen Potential: SNP MPs will press for the UK Government to secure progress with direct interconnection between Scotland and the continent and regulatory agreement to unlock Scotland’s hydrogen export potential. • Modernizing Support: They will push the UK Government to modernise the Contracts for Difference scheme to enable the stable deployment of Scotland’s renewable energy pipeline. • Equity Stake in Energy Projects: They demand the UK Government seek an equity stake in future energy projects. The return on this investment for the taxpayer would be used to directly benefit the Scottish people by protecting jobs, growing the green economy, and lowering energy bills. Just Transition and Fossil Fuels • Just Transition Fund: The SNP demands the new UK Government match Scotland’s £500 million Just Transition Fund for the North East and Moray to help build on the region’s expertise, create jobs, and deliver a fair and managed transition to net zero. • Oil and Gas Licensing: The UK Government, as the decision-maker on new oil and gas licenses, must ensure any further extraction is consistent with climate obligations and takes due account of energy security considerations. Decisions must be made on a rigorously evidence-led, case-by-case basis, through a robust climate compatibility assessment. • Grangemouth: The SNP stresses that the UK Government must invest in a sustainable future for the Grangemouth complex to retain the skilled workforce and protect jobs during the transition to greener technologies. • Coal: The manifesto states the party will ban new coal licences, following the lead of the SNP Scottish Government. Land, Biodiversity, and Resource Management • Fair Funding for Climate: The UK Government must ensure fair funding flows to devolved nations to enable climate ambition, especially considering Scotland has over two thirds of the UK’s peatland and currently plants over 60% of trees in the UK. • Marine Funding: The SNP demands that the UK Government give Scotland its rightful share of marine funding—specifically, the party claims Westminster shortchanged funding after Brexit, allocating only £14 million instead of the £62 million Scotland was entitled to. • Agriculture and Fishing: They call for the UK Government to increase funding for farming to at least pre-Brexit levels and provide multi-annual funding frameworks. They also prioritize Scotland’s unique fishing needs and call for meaningful engagement on the post-Brexit trade agreement review. Decarbonizing Transport • Zero-Emission Transport: SNP MPs will promote a fair and affordable transition to zero-emission transport fuels and ban the import and sale of new, non zero-emission buses by 2025. • Cleaner Vehicles: They will push the UK Government to establish a new Low Income EV Car Leasing Fund, backed by at least £500 million, to enable 50,000 EV leases a year for low-income families. • VAT Removal: They advocate for the removal of VAT from on-street electric vehicle charging. National Cooperation • The SNP calls for the establishment of a Four Nations Climate Response Group to agree on climate plans across the UK that deliver on net-zero targets and ensure the UK Government stops backtracking on climate ambition.",
          "brexit": "The Scottish National Party (SNP) holds strongly negative views on Brexit, asserting that it has been a \"disaster for Scotland\". Their policy goal is to reverse the damage caused by the UK’s departure from the European Union (EU). Here is a summary of the SNP’s views and policy commitments regarding Brexit: Core Stance and Consequences of Brexit • Opposition to Brexit: Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU but was \"dragged out against [its] will\" and is currently \"powerless to escape the consequences\". • Economic Damage: Brexit has wiped billions of pounds from the Scottish economy compared with EU membership. It is cited as a factor that has made the cost of living crisis worse by pushing up food prices and other household costs. The UK economy is described as having failed. • Damage to Public Services and Recruitment: The negative consequences of Brexit include hitting the ability to fund vital public services such as the NHS. The end of freedom of movement has made it much harder to recruit staff for the NHS, social care, and other vital sectors. • Security Concerns: Scotland has lost access to one of the world’s most sophisticated and integrated international justice and crime-fighting ecosystems. • Democratic Overriding: Westminster’s imposition of Brexit undermined the Scottish Parliament, which the people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly for, while simultaneously imposing something they voted overwhelmingly against. The UK Internal Market Act, enacted post-Brexit, has reduced the powers of the Scottish Parliament and allowed the UK Government to override Scottish democracy. • Political Consensus: The SNP argues that the \"Westminster conspiracy of silence between Labour and the Conservatives\" on the damage of Brexit demonstrates why decisions about Scotland’s future should be taken in Scotland. They stress that ignoring Brexit is ignoring the cost of living, the economy, and the views of Scotland. Policy to Reverse Brexit and Rejoin the EU The SNP’s long-term goal for Scotland is to rejoin the EU as an independent country. They commit to: 1. Rejoin the EU and re-enter the Single Market: The SNP will push to reverse the damage of Brexit and re-enter the single market. 2. Restore Free Movement: They aim to restore free movement for EU citizens. 3. Independence as the Vehicle: The SNP champions the vision of an independent Scotland in the EU, stating that independence is the means to regain what has been lost as a result of a hard Brexit. Expected Benefits of Rejoining the EU Rejoining the EU would deliver several specific benefits, according to the SNP : • Trade and Business: Cheaper and quicker trading for businesses. • Labour and Migration: Access to workers from across the EU, enabling many industries to grow , and freedom of movement to live, visit, study, and work freely in any EU country. • Education: Re-entry to the Erasmus+ scheme, widening educational opportunities. • Rural Sectors: More funding for farming, fishing, and other rural sectors. • Security: A safer Scotland, working closely with police in the EU to help fight cross-border crime, serious organized crime, cyber crime, and terrorism. • Culture: Access to the Creative Europe scheme, supporting the culture sector and boosting the economic potential of creative industries. Mitigation Efforts (Until Independence) While working towards independence, SNP MPs at Westminster will push for specific measures to mitigate the immediate harms of Brexit: • Farming and Fishing: Demand increased funding for farming to at least pre-Brexit levels , agree a veterinary agreement with the EU to ease exports and imports, and demand Scotland’s rightful share of marine funding. • Immigration: They seek the devolution of powers to create a bespoke migration system for Scotland to address demographic and economic needs. They will also push the UK Government to introduce a rural visa pilot scheme to mitigate labour shortages resulting from a hard Brexit and hostile immigration policies. • Workers: Demand the UK Government review immigration rules and expand shortage occupation lists to give businesses access to the necessary workforce. • Young People: Press the UK Government to agree to an EU-wide youth mobility scheme, which they note was rejected by both the Tories and Labour. The SNP views Brexit as intrinsically linked to the current austerity measures and the cost of living crisis, concluding that only independence will free Scotland from these negative impacts and allow them to build a more successful economy comparable to independent European nations.",
          "entire manifesto": "The SNP manifesto centers its key policies around the belief that decisions about Scotland should be made in Scotland through independence, which they view as the means to address concerns over the cost of living and the funding of the NHS. Here is a summary of the manifesto’s key policy areas: Independence and Constitutional Goals • Independence: The core goal is for Scotland to become an independent country. If the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats, the Scottish Government will be empowered to begin immediate negotiations with the UK Government to give democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country. • Devolution of Powers: Demand the permanent transfer of legal power to the Scottish Parliament to determine how Scotland is governed, including the power to legislate for a referendum. They also demand the devolution of new borrowing powers to invest in a just transition and the full devolution of tax powers. • Rejoining the EU: Rejoin the EU, reverse the damage of Brexit, re-enter the single market, and restore free movement for EU citizens. • Constitutional Reform: Support the abolition of the undemocratic House of Lords. • Defense: Scrap Trident and invest the money into conventional defense and public services, such as the NHS and schools. Economic Policy and Tackling Austerity • Ending Austerity: Deliver independence to strengthen the economy and end 14 years of austerity, reversing deep damaging cuts to public services. SNP MPs will stand against the Westminster consensus on cuts and demand increased investment in vital public services. • Capital Budget: Reverse the £1.3bn Westminster cut to the Scottish capital budget, enabling investment in new hospitals, schools, rail, and road infrastructure. • Fiscal Rules: Call on the UK Government to scrap their current fiscal rules to allow greater investment in infrastructure and public services. They propose new fiscal rules, including a Public Sector Net Worth rule and an upper limit on debt servicing costs. • Taxation: Demand the full devolution of tax powers to create a fairer system. They support reforming VAT, including introducing a lower rate for hospitality and tourism sectors, and removing VAT from on-street electric vehicle charging. They also advocate for the devolution of windfall taxation for companies operating in Scotland. Protecting the NHS and Public Services • NHS Protection and Funding: Protect Scotland’s NHS from the twin threats of Westminster privatization and austerity. They call on the UK Government to back their Bill to keep the NHS in public hands. • NHS Investment: Demand the UK Government boost NHS England funding by at least £16bn each year, which would provide an extra £1.6bn to NHS Scotland. They also call for matching Scotland’s NHS pay deals (generating around £600m for Scotland). • Education: Defend free university tuition in Scotland. • Justice: Tackle the drug death crisis by taking a radical public health approach, including decriminalizing drugs for personal use and introducing a framework to allow Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities. Cost of Living and Welfare • Essentials Guarantee: Legislate for an essentials guarantee ensuring that everyone can afford basic necessities like food and utilities. • Benefit Caps: Scrap the two child benefit cap, ending the suffering caused by the benefit cap on children and the associated rape clause. • Pensions and Compensation: Protect pensions by maintaining the triple lock and move to deliver a wellbeing pension. They will oppose any further increases in the state pension age. They also pledge to stand up for WASPI women by ensuring the UK Government delivers full, fast, and fair compensation for pension inequality. • Energy Costs: Press for a significant cut in standing charges for all and removal of standing charges for anyone with a prepayment meter. Workers’ Rights and Migration • Employment Rights: Demand the devolution of employment rights and the minimum wage. They will empower workers by scrapping exploitative zero hours contracts and banning callous \"fire and rehire\" practices. • Maternity/Parental Leave: Increase paid maternity leave to one year and increase shared parental leave from 52 to 64 weeks. • Migration: Demand the devolution of powers to create a bespoke migration system for Scotland to address specific demographic and economic needs. They will scrap the Rwanda scheme and stand firm against the demonization of migrants. They also propose a rural visa pilot scheme. Climate and Energy • Green Economy: Demand the UK Government match Scotland’s £500 million Just Transition Fund for the North East and Moray. • Renewables: Demand the devolution of powers over energy regulation, pricing, and production. They will rule out new nuclear power plants in Scotland. • Oil and Gas: Decisions on new oil and gas licences must be made on a rigorously evidence-led, case-by-case basis through a robust climate compatibility assessment. They stress the importance of securing a sustainable future for Grangemouth and retaining the skilled workforce. • Coal: Ban new coal licences. International Policy • Gaza/Palestine: Demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and the ending of arms sales to Israel. They call on the UK Government to immediately recognize Palestine as an independent state. • International Aid: Immediately restore and maintain the UK international aid budget to 0.7%. • Ukraine: Stand by Ukraine and continue to support Ukrainians who have settled in Scotland."

          "crime": "Plaid Cymru’s policies on crime and justice emphasize the full devolution of justice powers to Wales, proper funding for policing, prioritizing victims, and reforming approaches to drug use, women offenders, and protests. Here is a summary of the key policies regarding crime and justice: Devolution and Governance Plaid Cymru champions the transfer of full justice powers to Wales, arguing that it is necessary to create a distinct Welsh approach to policing and criminal justice. • Full Transfer of Justice Powers: Plaid Cymru supports the complete transfer of justice powers to Wales, a recommendation made by three independent commissions, including the Thomas Commission on Justice in Wales and the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future for Wales. • Minister of Justice: Following devolution, a Minister of Justice would be created within the Welsh Government, who would be accountable to the people of Wales, not Westminster. • Abolish Police and Crime Commissioners: A Plaid Cymru government would review the governance of criminal justice in Wales and remove the role of elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs), as the Minister for Justice would assume accountability. • Justice for All: Plaid Cymru believes everyone should have access to justice within their local community, and supports piloting a \"courts in the community scheme\" to resolve local justice needs and help reduce the backlog of court cases. They would also provide additional help to prevent legal aid \"deserts\". • Devolution Benefits: Devolving the criminal justice system would enable better collaboration between prisons and services already devolved (such as health and housing), which could reduce homelessness upon release and improve health provision. Policing and Funding The party seeks to ensure Welsh police forces are properly funded and transparent: • Fair Police Funding: While policing remains under Westminster control, Plaid Cymru will argue that policing must be properly funded to prevent crime and convict criminals. They point out that Wales currently receives less than its fair share of police funding per head of population, which forces local people to increase the council tax policing element just to maintain services. • Cardiff Funding: Additional funding should be provided to Cardiff, recognizing its status as a capital city and the security arrangements required for higher profile events, as already happens in other UK capitals. • Transparency: Plaid Cymru supports legislation requiring police officers to declare memberships of clubs, societies, and organizations to ensure transparency and public confidence in policing. • Rural Crime: To address the rise in rural crime, the party would work to create a specialist all-Wales rural crime team, aiming to recruit officers from the farming community, building on work already done by PCCs in North Wales and Dyfed-Powys. • Compensation for Policing Costs: Plaid Cymru believes Dyfed-Powys Police should be compensated by Westminster for the cost (£1m+) of policing protests at Llanelli’s Stradey Park Hotel related to a misguided UK Government plan that was later dropped. Victims and Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) Plaid Cymru places victims at the center of justice services: • Victims Commissioner for Wales: Plaid Cymru would create a Victims Commissioner for Wales to represent victims of crime, stand up for their rights, and prevent them from being forgotten. The Commissioner could also help increase the number of successful convictions for crimes against women and girls. • Preventing VAWG: The party recognizes the challenges in the criminal justice system to ensure women and girls are believed and receive justice. Measures include: ◦ Creating a Domestic Abuse Register to enable the early identification of abusive men, shifting responsibility away from potential victims (unlike Clare’s Law). ◦ Stopping abusers from harassing victims through court proceedings and strengthening restraining orders and sanctions for breaching them. ◦ Ensuring that convictions related to sexual images are always based on consent rather than intent to close legal loopholes. ◦ Increasing sentences for domestic violence and stalking offenses. ◦ Mandating specialist stalking training for all professionals dealing with stalking cases and a unified recording system across justice agencies. Prisons, Rehabilitation, and Female Offenders Wales has the highest imprisonment rate in Western Europe despite lacking control over criminal justice policy. Plaid Cymru seeks reform: • Opposing Private Prisons: Plaid Cymru does not support private prison provision, believing it is a state responsibility. They are alarmed by the deaths and criticisms at HMP Parc, a privately-run facility, and believe it should be brought back under full public control. • Focus on Rehabilitation: Sentencing policy should prioritize what prevents criminals from re-offending and being a danger to the public. This includes using community-based sentences for low-risk offenders and investing in community-based prevention and rehabilitation. • Fairness for Women in Justice: Most women serve short custodial sentences outside of Wales, which impacts family travel, Welsh language provision, and community connections. Plaid Cymru will focus on reducing crime by addressing the underlying reasons women become involved in criminal behavior and reviewing the effectiveness of short prison sentences for female offenders. • Women’s Centres: Plaid Cymru aims to establish four community-based women’s centers across Wales (north-west, north-east, south-west, and south-east) to support female offenders, working with Police and Crime Commissioners to achieve this. • Probation and Prison Staff: The party supports Napo’s calls for a strategic reduction program for the probation service, ensuring safe and manageable workloads. They will also address staff retention issues in the prison and probation services by reducing the prison officer pension age from 68. • Neurodiversity Support: Better support will be provided for people with ADHD transitioning through and leaving the prison system, including training for all prison staff in ADHD awareness and appropriate medication care plans. Drug Policy and Protest Rights Plaid Cymru supports treating drug policy as a public health issue and protecting non-violent protest: • Drugs Policing: Policing should focus on targeting supply lines and dealers in organized trade, rather than individual users who are not causing wider harm. Users should be supported to stop their addiction. • Public Health Approach: The party views drugs policy as a matter of public health and supports introducing drug consumption rooms across Wales to facilitate a more humane and sustainable approach to addiction. • Decriminalization: Plaid Cymru believes that introducing a policy of soft drugs decriminalisation could better target policing resources toward organized groups who profit from misery. • Criminal Records: They recommend the UK Home Office cleansing the criminal records of those cautioned or convicted of drug possession where there are no further aggravating factors. • Right to Protest: Plaid Cymru supports non-violent protest as an important democratic mechanism and the right to freedom of expression and assembly. They would repeal the Conservative UK Government legislation that unfairly restricts opportunities for non-violent protest, specifically mentioning the relevant parts of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023. They also support legislation that makes it a criminal offence for elected politicians to knowingly mislead the public. Plaid Cymru’s ambition for criminal justice is essentially to move the system’s locus of control from Westminster to Cardiff, enabling a tailored, needs-based approach—much like equipping a ship captain with navigational instruments and control over the rudder, rather than relying on distant headquarters, to better manage local waters.",
          "healthcare": "Plaid Cymru’s policies on healthcare, outlined under the banner of \"Fair Play for Patients,\" center on principles of funding the NHS according to Wales’s needs, expanding the workforce, establishing a National Care Service, and implementing specific strategies for public health challenges like cancer and neurodiversity. Here is a summary of the key healthcare policies: Funding and Principle of Care • Free at Point of Delivery: Plaid Cymru strongly believes in the principle of healthcare free at the point of delivery, funded through general taxation. • Opposing Privatisation: They oppose the privatization of services \"by stealth through out-sourcing\". They believe that profits currently made by private agencies should be re-invested into healthcare. • Needs-Based Funding: They will work to ensure the NHS is properly funded through a new fairer and needs-based funding model for Wales, replacing the outdated Barnett Formula. • Fair Funding from Westminster: They demand fair funding from Westminster to enable investment in the NHS workforce. Workforce and Recruitment The party prioritizes staff and aims to improve recruitment and retention: • GP Recruitment: Plaid Cymru will reverse the significant reduction in the number of GPs over the past decade. They plan to restore funding for GPs to 8.7% of the Welsh health budget and recruit an additional 500 GPs across Wales, noting this is a \"two-term pledge\" due to the time needed for recruitment and training. • Wage Restoration: They stand in solidarity with healthcare professionals taking industrial action on pay and wage restoration, believing these pledges must be implemented quickly to value staff and boost recruitment and retention. • Flexible Contracts: They would move toward an improved working contract for nurses, making contracts more flexible to reflect other responsibilities, such as caring and learning, and recruit more nurses. • Apprenticeships: They support increasing the availability of degree apprenticeships in the healthcare sector to provide greater opportunities for young people to enter the profession and remain working in Wales. • Agency Spending: They note that better workforce planning and recruitment to permanent posts will save money currently spent on high levels of agency staff. Social Care and Welfare Plaid Cymru aims to integrate social care with healthcare: • National Care Service: Plaid Cymru is committed to establishing a National Care Service for Wales. They believe social care, like health care, should be free at the point of use, viewing the distinction between the two as artificial. Ending this distinction is also intended to help reduce Delayed Transfers of Care (DToC). • Care Worker Pay: They will pay social care workers at least £1 above the Real Living Wage, and ensure this is index-linked, aiming to make the job more attractive and improve recruitment. • Ending Profit in Children’s Services: They are committed to consulting on the elimination of profit in children’s services provision, working towards the gradual expansion of direct provision in both children’s and adult services. • Family Carers and Visits: They advocate for the right of people to be supported by their family carers and seek clarity that it is a human right for family visits to care homes to support patients with dementia. • Visa Restrictions: They oppose restrictions on visas for care workers and dependents, viewing them as counter-productive to recruitment needs. Specific Health Strategies and Conditions Plaid Cymru proposes targeted action for various health issues: • Cancer Strategy: They would introduce a \"Stop Cancer Strategy\" to ensure cancers are caught and treated earlier. Key measures include: ◦ Ensuring no downgrading of urgent suspected cancer referrals. ◦ Lowering the sensitivity threshold for bowel cancer screening. ◦ Increasing rates of lung cancer screening. ◦ Investing in the workforce to recruit, train, and retain more oncology staff. ◦ Focusing on prehabilitation to better prepare people for treatment. ◦ Supporting the creation of a national register of Barrett’s oesophagus in Wales. • Neurodiversity: They would ensure that support is made available as soon as an individual presents themselves as neurodiverse (through referral or self-referral), to address long waiting lists for diagnosis. • Public Health: They believe public health should move toward becoming a \"wellness service\" geared toward keeping people healthy. This preventative strategy aims to rebalance resources to prevent people from becoming ill earlier than necessary. • Dental Care: Plaid Cymru would open a new dental school in Bangor as part of the new medical school to train more dentists and would scrap dental charge increases. • Long Covid: They recognize the significant number of people affected by Long Covid and state that appropriate support must be provided. • Gastrointestinal Conditions: They will reduce delays to diagnosis for Crohn’s and Colitis, coeliac disease, and IBS by implementing the national primary diagnostic pathway for lower gastrointestinal symptoms. • Respiratory Health: Noting that Wales has the highest level of respiratory deaths in Western Europe, they will deliver an improvement plan to improve the lives of people living with lung conditions. Governance, Safety, and Other Services • NHS Governance: Plaid Cymru will review NHS governance to strengthen oversight and accountability, focusing on small but significant cultural changes, streamlining targets, clarifying accountability, and recruiting specialist managers. They support a regulatory body for Senior Health Managers. • Covid Inquiry: They believe there should be a Wales-specific Inquiry into Covid to understand decisions made by the Labour Welsh Government and their impacts, as the UK-level Inquiry cannot cover this in necessary detail. • Patient Safety: They support the recommendations from the infected blood scandal Inquiry, including a duty of candour for all public servants and full compensation for those affected. They also support compensation and a duty of candour for mesh patients and those harmed by valproate, as proposed in the Hughes Report. • Air Ambulance: They want to see the continuation of the current Air Ambulance provision at Welshpool and Caernarfon, alongside a rapid response vehicle on the A55. • Community Pharmacies: They will support changes in legislation on drug tariffs to address rising prices and review the supply chain to ensure patients receive medication when needed. Plaid Cymru views healthcare reform as intrinsically linked to achieving full financial and constitutional control over Wales, believing that securing fair, needs-based funding (rather than relying on the Barnett Formula) is the necessary foundation to effectively invest in and improve health and social care services.",
          "housing": "Plaid Cymru’s housing policies are rooted in the belief that every individual has the right to a safe and affordable home in their community, and they intend to introduce a Right to Adequate Housing to underpin this goal. The policies focus on significantly increasing housing supply, tackling homelessness, addressing the impact of second and holiday homes, and reforming the private rental sector and planning system. Here is a summary of the key housing and planning policies: Increasing Housing Stock and Supply The primary objective is to significantly expand the availability of suitable housing, particularly social housing, across Wales. • Significant Expansion of Stock: The manifesto calls for a significant expansion in the amount of social and municipal housing stock. Increasing this stock is also viewed as a policy that would help tackle private rental sector rent rises. • Building Council Housing: Plaid Cymru supported ending the Housing Revenue Account Subsidy Scheme, which led to local authorities being able to build council housing once again. They will support local authorities and housing associations to develop further housing as quickly as possible. • Delivery Plan: Plaid Cymru will develop a plan to deliver this significant expansion to meet local housing needs across all parts of the country, utilizing a mixture of public and private funding streams. • Community Needs: When planning new developments, they will ensure the needs of the local community for healthcare, education, and transport are factored in, along with sufficient green space and local play facilities. • Demand for Specific Properties: They recognize there is a huge demand for one and two-bed properties, as well as bungalows for an aging population, which developers currently fail to build. Tackling Homelessness The party aims to end homelessness by increasing housing stock and implementing proven models: • Ending Homelessness: Plaid Cymru has prioritized tackling homelessness in the Senedd and will look to end homelessness using the Housing First model and rapid rehousing. • Recognizing Hidden Homelessness: They recognize that the challenge extends beyond those sleeping rough or in temporary accommodation, including people staying with friends and family. • Empty Properties: They have campaigned to increase council tax premiums on long-term empty or unused properties. Funds raised from these premiums have been used to fund grants to increase the supply of affordable homes. They state there is \"no good reason why so many properties are left empty\". Addressing Second Homes and Holiday Homes Plaid Cymru advocates for measures to ensure local people can afford to live in the communities where they were raised. • Cap on Second Homes: They support a package of actions to tackle the challenge of second and holiday homes, including introducing a cap on the number of second and holiday homes within a community. • Registration and Change of Use: They support giving local authorities the power to require registration of a change of use for a property turning into a holiday home. • Closing Loopholes: They are looking to close loopholes that allow holiday homes to \"pretend to be legitimate lettings businesses\" to protect genuine self-catered accommodation. • Council Tax Premium: They note that many local authorities have already introduced a council tax premium on second homes, with the additional funds used towards developing social housing for local residents. Private Rental Sector and Planning Reform Plaid Cymru seeks to make renting affordable and overhaul the planning system to prioritize community needs over developer interests. • Fair Rents and Rent Control: Within the private rental sector, they believe in a system of fair rents and rent control so that housing is affordable to local people on local incomes. • Market Interventions: Their proposed Right to Adequate Housing Bill would include powers to introduce rent controls and other market interventions to make housing more affordable. • Planning System Reform: They believe the current planning system is outdated and often leaves communities \"at the mercy of large developers who build executive homes for profit\". • Prioritizing Local Needs: They will reform the planning system to be consistent with local needs and aspirations, ensuring that developments reflect up-to-date information on housing need. • Enforcement: They support funding packages to assist local government to robustly enforce planning decisions to ensure developers adhere to agreements. • Local Development Plans: They will ensure that Local Development Plans are not imposed upon local planning authorities without their support. Construction and Local Economy Plaid Cymru’s \"Unnos\" policy aims to link house-building with supporting the Welsh economy and skills: • Welsh Construction Industry: The \"Unnos\" policy aims to support the Welsh construction industry by creating centres of excellence in both new construction and retrofitting existing housing stock. • Local Supply Chains: They will work to develop Welsh local supply chains and skilled labour so that profits from the Welsh house-building industry are retained in Wales, rather than exported by large \"volume\" housebuilders. In essence, Plaid Cymru views housing as a fundamental right that requires government intervention, similar to how a public library system ensures equal access to books. By enforcing a \"Right to Adequate Housing\" and aggressively increasing affordable stock and regulating private markets, they aim to ensure the housing supply serves the social needs of Welsh communities rather than merely the profit interests of developers.",
          "immigration": "Plaid Cymru’s policies on migration and asylum are focused on reversing what they describe as a \"hostile environment\" created by the Conservative UK Government, upholding international commitments, and seeking greater powers for Wales to manage its own migration needs. Here is a summary of the key policies on migration and asylum: Asylum and Refugee Policy Plaid Cymru strongly opposes the current UK Government’s approach and advocates for a humane and effective system: • Opposing Hostile Policies: Plaid Cymru strongly oppose the Conservative UK Government’s proposals and attitudes towards asylum seekers and refugees, including the deportation to Rwanda and the general \"hostile environment\" created. • Upholding Commitments: They believe the UK should uphold the commitments made when it signed up to the Refugee Treaty in 1951. • Repeal Hostile Legislation: They support the repeal of previous punitive legislation that forms part of the hostile environment, specifically mentioning the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the Illegal Migration Act 2023. • Safe and Humane Processing: They assert that the UK Government has failed to provide safe routes for asylum seekers and has deliberately failed to process claims quickly, effectively, and humanely, leading to deaths at sea and unnecessary misery. • Effective Management: Effective management of the asylum process could allow processing to take place prior to reaching the UK in a third country, or at British embassies or consulates abroad. A program showing the likely outcome of an asylum application would also help manage the process. • Proportionate Dispersal: The responsibility for asylum seekers and dispersal should be proportionate across the UK. • Family Reunification: They support a family reunification scheme for those caught up in the conflict in Gaza, with a clear right to return to their homeland when safe to do so. Wales as a Nation of Sanctuary Plaid Cymru aims to secure the ability for Wales to fully realize its ambition to be a Nation of Sanctuary: • Nation of Sanctuary: Wales should have the powers and resources to fulfill its pledge to become a Nation of Sanctuary. • Opposition to Increased Barriers: They oppose Conservative proposals to increase the skilled worker and family visa threshold, as well as fee increases. • Ending \"No Recourse to Public Funds\": Plaid Cymru believes changes should be made to the system, including the ending of the \"No Recourse to Public Funds\" clause and ending the inability to work while awaiting decisions, as these unnecessarily force people into poverty. • Welcoming Migrants: They emphasize that migrants play an important role in Welsh society, contributing to many occupations, especially social care and healthcare, and their contributions should be welcomed, not criticized. Devolution of Migration Powers The party seeks greater constitutional control over migration to meet Wales’s economic needs: • Greater Powers: Plaid Cymru believes that, similar to Quebec in Canada, Wales should have greater powers over migration. • Shortage Occupation List and Visa Schemes: This should include the ability for Wales to determine its own Shortage Occupation List and granting the Welsh Government the ability to manage its own visa schemes. • Retaining the Graduate Route Visa: They support the Migration Advisory Committees’ recommendation that the graduate route visa be retained. They are concerned that current proposals regarding this visa would detrimentally affect Welsh universities (such as Bangor and Aberystwyth) and local communities where universities are major employers. European Context • Freedom of Movement: Plaid Cymru believes that Wales would be best served by re-joining the European Union at an appropriate point in time, and notes that Freedom of Movement has been \"damagingly denied\" since leaving the EU. Plaid Cymru frames its immigration policy as a necessary correction to damaging Westminster policies, aiming to install a humane, efficient system that respects international law while simultaneously granting Wales the autonomy to manage migration flows in a way that supports its critical public services and higher education sector.",
          "defence": "Plaid Cymru’s policies on defense and foreign affairs focus on promoting peace, opposing nuclear weapons, reforming arms sales, and ensuring better support for veterans. They also assert the need for the Senedd to have a consultative role in UK military decisions. Here is a summary of the key policies on defense: Nuclear Weapons and Spending • Opposition to Trident: Plaid Cymru opposes the Trident nuclear weapons system and its renewal. They note that the renewal is estimated to cost more than £200 billion. • Alternative Spending: They support the view that if defense spending is required, it should be better used on conventional defense and peaceful ends, rather than weapons of mass destruction. • Nuclear Treaty Support: They support the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. • Opposing Defence Increases: They oppose increasing defense spending. Military Action and Arms Sales • Consultation on Military Action: Plaid Cymru believes that the Senedd should be consulted before the UK Government decides to engage in military action. • Arms Export Review: They demand a review of the arms export control system and a clear statement of intent to withdraw from the international arms supply trade. • Withholding Licenses: They believe the UK should withhold licenses to sell arms to countries which have poor human rights records, or where there is credible evidence that the weapons will be used for the repression of their own populations or in violation of international law. • Promoting Peace: Plaid Cymru supports peaceful and negotiated outcomes to all conflict. Support for Veterans • Improved Support: Veterans require substantially improved support upon leaving armed service and returning to civilian life. • Medical Discharge Review: Plaid Cymru calls for an independent review of the medical discharge process. • Income Disregard: They propose introducing an income disregard for the War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Scheme so that these payments are not considered as income when calculating benefits and pensions.",
          "economy": "Plaid Cymru’s economic policies are founded on the principle that Wales must secure full financial and economic control to move away from stagnation and widespread deprivationPlaid Cymru’s economic policies are founded on the principle that Wales must secure full financial and economic control to move away from stagnation and widespread deprivation caused by decades of Westminster rule. The manifesto sets out comprehensive plans for fair funding, tax reform, industrial strategy, devolution of key resources, and support for Welsh businesses and workers. Here is a summary of Plaid Cymru’s key economic policies: Fair Funding and Fiscal Control Plaid Cymru asserts that the UK Government’s economic policies have been \"economically very damaging\" for Wales. The party demands structural changes to how Wales is funded and governed: • Securing £4 Billion from HS2: Demand the £4 billion owed to Wales from the HS2 high-speed rail project, which is deemed an England-only project. This money would be invested in improving public transport across the country and reversing cuts to local bus services. • New Needs-Based Funding: Demand a fair funding system for Wales, replacing the outdated Barnett Formula, to fund the country according to its needs, rather than proportionate to spending on England’s needs. • Full Control of Economic Levers: Plaid Cymru believes Wales should have full control of economic levers to grow and \"green our economy\" in a way that positively impacts communities. • Tax Devolution: They want the Senedd to have powers to set income tax bands and thresholds, as is done in Scotland, to create a system that fits Wales’s circumstances. Tax Reform Plaid Cymru advocates for a fairer tax burden, primarily falling on those with the \"broadest shoulders\" : • Equalizing Capital Gains Tax: Plaid Cymru would equalize capital gains tax with income tax, which is estimated to raise between £12 billion and £15 billion. • Increased Windfall Taxes: They seek to increase windfall taxes on sectors that have substantially increased profits due to market conditions, such as oil and gas producers and energy companies, and will close existing loopholes used to avoid these taxes. They promote renewable energy investment as an alternative. • Wealth Tax and High Earners: They support investigating the introduction of a wealth tax and increasing National Insurance contributions for higher earners. • Closing Loopholes: They would crack down on tax evasion and avoidance, and abolish loopholes for non-doms. • Bankers’ Bonuses: They would re-introduce the cap on bankers’ bonuses. Industrial Strategy and Key Sectors The party supports interventionist policies to support key Welsh industries and transition to a green economy: • Port Talbot Steelworks: Plaid Cymru opposes Tata’s plans for closure and urges the UK Government to nationalise the Port Talbot steelworks. If the UK Government fails to act, the Welsh Government should explore compulsory purchase options while developing future options for green steel production. They believe Wales needs to retain the ability to produce primary steel. • Welsh Green New Deal: They will create a Welsh Green New Deal to generate rewarding, meaningful, and fair work in emerging sectors, including re-skilling Welsh employees. • Just Transition Commission: They will establish a Just Transition Commission as part of the move toward net-zero. • Measuring Success: In the run-up to the 2026 Senedd elections, they will set new targets for the Welsh economy to measure the impact of policy decisions through outcomes rather than process. Devolution of Natural Resources and Finance Plaid Cymru aims to take control of key Welsh assets to build domestic wealth and prosperity: • Crown Estate Devolution: They will ensure Wales takes full control over the Crown Estate in Wales, which has already been devolved to Scotland. • Sovereign Wealth Fund: Profits from the Crown Estate (especially from energy projects in Welsh waters) would be invested in a Sovereign Wealth Fund for Wales for future generations. • Control over Energy and Water: They seek \"full control over energy powers\" without UK Government limits, including expanding the national energy company, Ynni Cymru, to develop community-owned renewable energy. They also seek to fully align the Senedd’s legislative competence over water with the geographical boundary of Wales. • Development Agency for Wales: They will establish a fit-for-purpose National Development Agency for Wales. • Development Bank Reform: They will reform the Development Bank of Wales, aiming for it to take greater equity shares in emerging businesses and invest in infrastructure projects, acting more like a real national development bank. They will also ensure the Welsh Government has the power to develop a community bank. Supporting Welsh Business and Workers • Business Rates Reform: They support reforming Non-Domestic Rates (Business Rates) in Wales to better support small businesses, reversing reductions in support and amending the multiplier to help high street businesses like retail and hospitality. • Local Procurement: They will work towards a target of 75% of Welsh public sector spend being with companies located in Wales, promoting local supply chains and investment. • Co-operative Models: They will promote co-operative, employee, and community ownership models, particularly in green industries and communities where private capital is unwilling to invest. • Workers’ Rights: They support the devolution of employment law. At the UK level, they would reverse the Tories’ anti-strike legislation, outlaw \"fire and re-hire\" tactics, abolish compulsory zero-hours contracts, and establish the right to \"disconnect\" (not to be routinely contacted about work outside normal hours). They also propose an apprenticeship living wage and support for colleges to reduce financial burdens on students. • European Union: They believe the UK should re-enter the European Single Market and Customs Union at the earliest opportunity to mitigate the negative impact of Brexit on Welsh business. • Digital Infrastructure: They would seek to invest in digital infrastructure to guarantee a high-speed connection to every home and business in rural and valley areas, supporting flexible working and Welsh businesses in global markets. Plaid Cymru’s economic vision is centered on the transfer of power and resources to Wales, viewing the lack of self-governance as the primary inhibitor to economic success and fairness. Their plan aims to switch the national economy from one characterized by \"all risk and no reward\" under Westminster to one of controlled, needs-based investment and wealth retention.",
          "education": "Plaid Cymru views education as the key to Wales’s future, aiming to create a system where both learners and the workforce can thrive. The policies focus on reducing the cost of education, investing heavily in the workforce, reforming post-16 learning, supporting the Welsh language, and ensuring fair funding. Here is a summary of Plaid Cymru’s key policies on education: Cost of Education and Access Plaid Cymru aims to eliminate financial barriers to learning: • Universal Free School Meals: Plaid Cymru will continue to campaign for universal free school meals for all secondary school learners (Years 7 to 11), building on the successful roll-out in primary schools which the party secured. This ensures all children receive a nutritious meal every day. • Reducing School Costs: They stress the importance of reducing the cost of the school day for families, including expenses related to transport, uniforms, and extra-curricular activities, ensuring no learner misses out on opportunities due to their family’s financial position. • Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA): The party helped secure the extension of the EMA. Workforce and School Investment The party plans to invest in teachers and support staff to enhance service delivery: • Securing Fair Funding: By securing fair funding for Wales, Plaid Cymru will ensure schools are resourced to provide the education and support learners need. • Recruitment and Retention: They will invest in the workforce, ensuring teachers and support staff are supported and valued to improve both recruitment and retention. Specifically, they aim to recruit and retain 5,000 teachers and support staff. • Teacher Incentives and Workload: This includes reviewing all bursary schemes to incentivize teachers and help fill recruitment gaps, and working with teaching unions to reduce bureaucracy and workload. • Support Staff: They would appoint more non-teaching staff to deal with pupil needs beyond education and develop a more attractive and formalized career pathway for teaching assistants. • Curriculum Review: They will conduct a review of Initial Teacher Education and Continuing Professional Development to assess their relevance to the demands of the new curriculum. • Specialist Support: Investment will be made in Additional Learning Needs (ALN) provision and mental health support. • School Safety: Prioritizing the safety of both learners and staff, they believe investment in the workforce will create a safer learning environment for all, actively working to stamp out bullying, racism, and homophobia. • Reviewing ALN Act and Curriculum: Reviewing the implementation of the new Curriculum for Wales and the Additional Learning Needs Act is essential to ensure consistency in education and support across Wales, which includes providing the necessary training and resources to the workforce. Private School Reform Plaid Cymru advocates for ending taxpayer support for private fee-paying schools: • Scrapping Charitable Status: They would scrap the charitable status of private fee-paying schools. • Taxation: They would charge VAT on fees and remove the exemption from business rates for these schools. Early Years and Welsh Language Education The party has an ambitious vision for Welsh-medium early years provision: • Vision for Meithrin Cymru: Their vision is for a national and free Welsh-medium early years education and childcare service, Meithrin Cymru, providing high-quality provision for children aged 12 months until they are eligible for full-time education. • Childcare Workforce: This requires investment in the childcare workforce, including offering free Welsh language learning opportunities in the English-medium sector so they can participate in the scheme. • Welsh Language Education Act: They believe there should be a Welsh Language Education Act working towards universal Welsh medium education. • Fluency Targets: They aim to ensure all children have access to quality Welsh language teaching to enable them to achieve fluency through their school life. • Multilingualism: They support the goal that all learners should leave school able to speak both Welsh and English fluently, as well as at least one other language. The decline in learners taking Welsh or modern languages at A level is a concern. Post-16 and Higher Education Plaid Cymru seeks to reform vocational training and increase university access: • Vocational Education: They will place vocational education on the same foundations as academic learning in school and university. • Lifetime Learning Allowance: They propose creating a Lifetime Learning Allowance for training or retraining, consisting of grants, loans, and a right to free provision. This includes offering a grant of £5,000 to the Personal Learning Accounts of every individual over 25 to train or retrain, with additional loans available to cover costs. They plan to trial this first with those who have been recently made redundant. • Free University Education: Their ambition remains to make University education free again for all. They will work with Universities to develop a plan to make them financially viable to achieve this goal. • Supporting Welsh Universities: They recognize the crisis in the higher education sector and warn it is in need of urgent support. They will work to expand the numbers studying at Welsh universities. • Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol: They will continue to support and increase funding for the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol to fund and promote higher and further education through the medium of Welsh, and recruit and train a bilingual workforce. • Seren Programme: They will review the Seren programme to increase access for learners from disadvantaged backgrounds and better align it with opportunities offered by Welsh Higher Education Institutions. • R&D Funding: They seek to devolve Wales’s share of UK Research and Innovation expenditure and allocate a block grant based on population for investment in Research and Development. Plaid Cymru’s approach treats education not just as a service but as an investment, aiming to remove financial barriers (like school meal costs and future tuition fees) and bolster the workforce, similar to meticulously preparing the soil and providing proper tools to ensure every single seed can grow into a thriving plant.",
          "environment": "Plaid Cymru’s policies on the environment and climate crisis prioritize constitutional change to gain full control over natural resources, ambitious net-zero targets, and an interventionist approach to energy generation and infrastructure, ensuring a \"just transition\" for Welsh communities. Here is a summary of the key policies on the environment and energy: Climate and Nature Emergency Commitments Plaid Cymru recognizes the gravity of the climate and nature crises and sets ambitious targets: • Net-Zero Target: Plaid Cymru reaffirms its commitment to reaching net-zero targets in Wales by 2035. • Reversing Biodiversity Decline: The party commits to reversing biodiversity decline by 2030. The Senedd, following a Plaid Cymru debate in 2021, was the first parliament in the UK to declare a nature emergency. • Science-Led Plan: They support a science-led plan aligned with the 2022 Kunming-Montreal: Plaid Cymru reaffirms its commitment to reaching net-zero targets in Wales by 2035. • Reversing Biodiversity Decline: The party commits to reversing biodiversity decline by 2030. The Senedd, following a Plaid Cymru debate in 2021, was the first parliament in the UK to declare a nature emergency. • Science-Led Plan: They support a science-led plan aligned with the 2022 Kunming-Montreal agreement to ensure that nature loss is firmly in reverse as soon as possible. • Planning Alignment: Planning projects must have regard to the two emergencies (climate and nature) to avoid situations like wind farms being built on landscapes that provide habitats for endangered species. • Curriculum: The school curriculum should equip young people with an understanding of climate challenges and encourage engagement with climate change and the natural world. Devolution of Natural Resources and Energy Control A central plank of Plaid Cymru’s environmental policy is securing full control over Wales’s natural assets: • Full Control of Natural Resources: They believe the people of Wales should have full control over all of their natural resources, waters, and lands. • Energy Independence: They seek energy independence for Wales to achieve a fair green transition on Wales’s own terms. • Devolution of Energy Powers: They demand full control over energy powers, without any upper limit or conditions set by the UK Government. The current 350MW limit results in two planning regimes, allowing major energy developments to be consented by Westminster without Welsh consent. • Crown Estate Devolution: Plaid Cymru will ensure Wales takes full control over the Crown Estate in Wales (which has already been devolved to Scotland). ◦ Profits from Crown Estate energy projects in Welsh waters should be returned to Wales and invested in a Sovereign Wealth Fund for Wales for future generations. ◦ These projects should be developed for the needs of Wales, rather than extraction, and align with local supply chains. • Water Control: Full control of water in Wales would allow the Senedd to set higher environmental targets on water quality and lower prices. They would enact Section 48(1) of the Wales Act 2017 to align the Senedd’s legislative competence over water with the geographical boundary of Wales, and formally request powers over the licensing of sewage. Energy Generation and Fossil Fuels Plaid Cymru advocates for renewable energy development and opposes harmful practices: • National Energy Company: They support expanding the role of the national energy company, Ynni Cymru, to develop community-owned renewable energy generation across Wales. This is intended to serve the needs of the Welsh people, help take control of natural resources, and lower energy bills. • Grid Reform: They would push for changes to how the National Grid is structured so communities can directly benefit from local energy projects. They note that underinvestment in the grid is creating bottlenecks and hindering carbon reduction targets. • Opposition to Fossil Fuels: Plaid Cymru opposes the development of new sites for nuclear power stations and oil and gas drilling. They would maintain the ban on fracking, oppose proposals for gas-fired peaking plants, and oppose new open cast coal mines. • Preserving Natural Landscape: Large-scale industrial energy generation developments should consider the preservation of Wales’s natural landscape. They insist on alternative methods for linking renewable energy to the national grid, such as the undergrounding of cables, instead of large-scale pylons. Dealing with the Legacy of Mining and Energy Costs • Coal Tip Clearance: They will push for Westminster to pay towards clearing the coal tips that litter the valleys, as they benefited from the mining industry before devolution. Site restoration should not be financed through further coal extraction. • Reducing Energy Charges: They note that Welsh households, despite Wales producing more energy than it uses, have higher standing charges than in England, and they would look to reduce these charges. • Social Tariff: They want to see the introduction of a Social Tariff for Energy. • Retrofitting and Efficiency: They support a plan for retrofitting existing properties to make them more energy efficient, reducing costs and carbon emissions. This requires government support and investment in a skilled workforce. • Alternative Heating: They support removing the tax on renewable liquid fuels (like Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil, which reduces carbon emissions by almost 90%) to make them more affordable for rural households where renewable technologies like heat pumps are unsuitable. Planning, Finance, and Enforcement • Community Voice: They would push for changes to planning policies to give local communities a greater voice and ownership in determining local developments. • Air Passenger Duty: They will increase Air Passenger Duty and kerosene tax for private jets. • Business, Human Rights and Environment Bill: They would introduce this bill to mandate that private companies conduct due diligence in their supply chains to prevent environmental harms (and human rights abuses). • Stronger Enforcement: There should be stronger enforcement for the protection of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in Wales to prevent illegal dumping. Plaid Cymru’s environmental policy aims to seize control of Wales’s energy and water resources, much like a landowner taking back management of their estate’s forests and rivers to ensure sustainable, ethical, and locally beneficial usage, rather than allowing external actors to extract wealth and create long-term pollution burdens.",
          "brexit": "Plaid Cymru’s policies on Brexit focus on recognizing the damage caused by the process and advocating for the UK to re-enter the European Single Market and Customs Union as soon as practical, while seeking eventual re-joining of the European Union. Here is a summary of the policies related to Brexit: • Recognition of Failure: Plaid Cymru campaigned in 2016 for Wales to remain in the European Union, recognizing the social and economic benefits of membership. However, the party respected the result of the referendum. They now explicitly recognize the failure of Brexit and assert that the hard Brexit pursued by both Theresa May and Boris Johnson undermined the UK’s international trade. • Re-entry to Single Market and Customs Union: Plaid Cymru believes that the UK should re-enter the European Single Market and Customs Union at the earliest opportunity. This move is intended to mitigate the impact of Brexit on Welsh business and reduce overheads and administrative costs. This will also help improve trade with European neighbors, including the Republic of Ireland, assisting Welsh ports such as Holyhead and Fishguard. • Re-joining the European Union: Plaid Cymru maintains the belief that Wales would be best served by re-joining the European Union at an appropriate point in time. • Freedom of Movement: They note that Freedom of Movement has been \"damagingly denied\" since leaving the European Union. • Participation in European Programmes: Wales should be enabled to participate in pan-European programmes to support its university and creative sectors in particular. • Governance and Consultation: Until the UK re-joins the Single Market and Customs Union, the Welsh Government should participate fully in the structures governing the current EU-UK relationship, established under the Withdrawal and Trade and Co-operation Agreements. Wales should be at the table whenever decisions are made about and for the nation. • Funding Replacement: Plaid Cymru demands that decisions around the distribution and use of the Shared Prosperity Fund, which replaced European Structural Funds, should be made by the Welsh Government, not by the UK Government at Westminster. • Trade Deals: They note that Westminster’s post-Brexit trade deals have allowed more cheap imports to undermine domestic markets (specifically affecting farming). Plaid Cymru will give Wales a veto over future trade deals that undermine Welsh agricultural communities.",
          "entire manifesto": "The Plaid Cymru manifesto, \"For Fairness, For Ambition, For Wales,\" sets out a vision for a fairer, more ambitious future for Wales, prioritizing self-governance, economic reform, and improved public services. The key policies focus on securing better funding from Westminster, addressing economic and social inequalities, and further devolution, with independence highlighted as the ultimate goal to achieve real fairness and ambition. Here is a summary of the manifesto’s key policy areas: Fair Funding and Constitutional Reform Plaid Cymru advocates for Wales to have full control over its own affairs, ultimately as an outward looking independent nation. Key constitutional and financial demands include: • Securing £4 Billion from HS2: Demand the £4 billion owed to Wales from the HS2 high-speed rail project (which is deemed an England-only project) to invest in improving public transport across the country and reversing cuts to local bus services. • New Needs-Based Funding Model: Demand a fair funding system for Wales, replacing the outdated Barnett Formula, to fund the country according to need, not population. This is necessary to invest in public services. • Devolution: Support the transfer of further powers to the Senedd, including criminal justice, broadcasting, natural resources (water and energy), railway infrastructure, the Crown Estate, and welfare. • Abolishing the Secretary of State for Wales: Remove this role, transferring remaining powers to the Welsh Government, as the role currently acts as \"Westminster’s voice in Wales, not Wales’s voice in Westminster\". • Senedd Referendum Power: Believe that the power to call a referendum on the constitutional future of Wales should lie with the Senedd, not the UK Government. Economy and Taxation The party aims to redress economic unfairness and gain full control of economic levers : • Tax Reform: Seek to introduce a fairer tax system by equalising capital gains tax with income tax (raising between £12bn and £15bn), investigating introducing a wealth tax, increasing higher earners’ National Insurance contributions, closing tax loopholes, and abolishing non-dom status. • Windfall Tax: Increase windfall taxes on companies that have substantially increased profits due to market conditions (such as oil and gas producers and energy companies), while promoting renewable energy investment. • Crown Estate Devolution: Ensure Wales takes full control over the Crown Estate in Wales (already devolved to Scotland), creating a Sovereign Wealth Fund for Wales to invest profits in future generations. • Port Talbot Steelworks: Oppose Tata’s plans for closure and urge the UK Government to nationalise the Port Talbot steelworks. Failing this, the Welsh Government should explore compulsory purchase. • European Union: Re-enter the European Single Market and Customs Union at the earliest opportunity to mitigate Brexit’s impact on Welsh business. • Supporting Welsh Business: Reform Non-Domestic Rates (Business Rates) to better support small businesses. Work towards a target of 75% of Welsh public sector spend being with companies located in Wales. • Workers’ Rights: Reverse the Tories’ anti-strike legislation, outlaw \"fire and re-hire\" tactics, abolish compulsory zero-hours contracts, and establish the right to \"disconnect\". Health and Social Care Plaid Cymru prioritizes a principle of healthcare free at the point of delivery and advocates for a needs-based funding model : • Recruitment and Funding: Secure fair funding to invest in the NHS workforce, including recruiting 500 additional GPs into Wales. Restore funding for GPs to 8.7% of the Welsh health budget. • Cancer Strategy: Introduce a new Cancer Strategy (\"Stop Cancer Strategy\") to ensure cancers are caught and treated earlier, including increasing lung cancer screening and lowering the sensitivity threshold for bowel cancer screening. • National Care Service: Commit to establishing a National Care Service for Wales so that social care, like healthcare, is free at the point of use. • Social Care Pay: Pay social care workers at least £1 above the Real Living Wage, index-linked, to improve recruitment and retention. • Neurodiversity: Ensure support is available as soon as an individual presents as neurodiverse, addressing long waiting lists for diagnosis. Welfare and Tackling Poverty The manifesto targets the reduction and eventual abolition of child poverty as a major goal : • Child Benefit Increase: Help 330,000 Welsh families by increasing Child Benefit by £20 per week, aiming to lift 60,000 children out of poverty. • Benefit Cap/Two-Child Limit: Abolish the Conservative policy of the two-child limit on Universal Credit payments and end the benefit cap. • Essentials Guarantee: Support an Essentials Guarantee level to ensure all individuals and families receive at least the minimum amount required for daily life (calculated at £120/week for an individual). • Pensions: Maintain the Triple Lock pension increase and increase the income tax personal allowance for pensioners in line with the triple lock. • Benefit Sanctions: Oppose benefit sanctions and shorten the timetable for the first payment of Universal Credit. Education and Skills Plaid Cymru focuses on creating an environment where both learners and the workforce can thrive : • Free School Meals: Continue campaigning for universal free school meals for all secondary school learners (Years 7 to 11). • Workforce Investment: Recruit and retain 5,000 teachers and support staff. • Private Schools: Scrap the charitable status of private fee-paying schools and charge VAT on their fees, removing their exemption from business rates. • Early Years: Vision for a national and free Welsh-medium early years education and childcare service, Meithrin Cymru, for children aged 12 months until they are eligible for full-time education. • Higher Education: Ambition remains to make University education free again for all. Introduce a Lifetime Learning Allowance for training/retraining, providing a grant of £5,000 to the Personal Learning Accounts of every individual over 25. Environment and Energy The party reaffirms its commitment to reaching net-zero targets in Wales by 2035 and reversing biodiversity decline by 2030. • Energy Control: Seek full control over energy powers without UK Government limits and expand the role of the national energy company, Ynni Cymru, to develop community-owned renewable energy. • Fossil Fuels: Oppose the development of new nuclear power sites, oil and gas drilling, gas-fired peaking plants, and new open cast coal mines. • Coal Tip Clearance: Push for Westminster to pay towards clearing the coal tips that litter the valleys, as they benefited from the mining industry before devolution. • Energy Bills: Look to reduce high standing charges on energy bills in Wales. Introduce a Social Tariff for Energy. Criminal Justice and Housing Plaid Cymru supports the full transfer of justice powers to Wales : • Justice Devolution: Support the full transfer of justice powers to Wales, as recommended by independent commissions, and create a Minister of Justice in the Welsh Government. • Victims Commissioner: Create a Victims Commissioner for Wales to represent victims of crime. • Housing Right: Introduce a Right to Adequate Housing which underpins the goal that everybody has the right to a safe and affordable home in their community. • Social/Municipal Housing: Significant expansion in the amount of social and municipal housing stock. • Rent Control and Second Homes: Introduce a system of fair rents and rent control in the private rental sector. Support measures to tackle second and holiday homes, including a cap on numbers and closing loopholes. Plaid Cymru’s overall approach is one of demanding control and investment for Wales, believing that many of the nation’s problems stem from its subordinate relationship with Westminster. Like a specialized mechanic asking for the right tools and budget to fix a custom-made engine, Plaid Cymru is demanding the specific economic and legislative powers—and the outstanding financial resources—needed to address Wales’s unique challenges effectively."

        {
          "crime": "The Liberal Democrat manifesto section dedicated to \"Crime and Policing\" outlines several key policies focused on crime prevention, improving police responsiveness, strengthening the criminal justice system, and supporting victims. Here is a summary of the core policies on crime and policing: 1. Restoring Community Policing and Investigation The Liberal Democrats aim to make communities safer by ensuring police are visible, trusted, and effective at solving crimes. Key actions include: • Community Policing: Restoring proper community policing, where officers are visible, trusted, and focused on preventing and solving crimes, particularly rape and other violent crime. • Investigating Burglaries: Creating a new statutory guarantee that all burglaries will be attended by the police and properly investigated. • Addressing Staff Shortages: Urgently drawing up a national recruitment, training, and retention strategy to tackle the shortage of detectives. They will also ensure fair pay rises for police officers by reforming the Police Remuneration Review Body to make it properly independent of government. 2. Addressing Specific Crimes and Vulnerabilities The policies include targeted actions against fraud, violence against women and girls (VAWG), youth violence, and modern slavery. • Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG): Ensuring survivors of VAWG are properly supported in the criminal justice process, including through mandatory training for police and prosecutors in understanding the impact of trauma on survivors. They also plan to embed domestic abuse specialists in every police force and 999 operator assistance centre. • Youth Violence: Adopting a public health approach to the epidemic of youth violence, focusing on identifying and treating risk factors rather than just symptoms. This involves police, teachers, health professionals, youth workers, and social services working closely together. They will also invest in youth services and make youth diversion a statutory duty across the country. • Online Crime and Fraud: Creating a new Online Crime Agency to effectively tackle illegal content and activity online, such as personal fraud, revenge porn, and threats and incitement to violence on social media. They will also combat the rise of fraud and scams by naming and shaming the banks with the worst records, requiring banks to reimburse victims of automated push payment scams (unless the victim is clearly at fault), and launching a public awareness campaign. • Modern Slavery and Trafficking: Reversing Conservative rollbacks of modern slavery protections and transferring responsibility for identifying modern slavery victims from the Home Office to local safeguarding agencies. 3. Judicial System Reform and Reducing Reoffending The manifesto pledges to clear court backlogs and improve the effectiveness of prisons and rehabilitation. • Tackling Court Backlogs: Investing in the criminal justice system to tackle the backlog of court cases and ensure swift justice. They will set a clear target of halving the time from offence to sentencing for all criminals. • Prison Reform: Breaking the cycle of reoffending by improving rehabilitation in prisons and on release. This includes ending prison overcrowding, recruiting more prison officers, and improving the provision of training, education, and work opportunities in prisons. • Rehabilitation: Introducing a National Resettlement Plan to improve the rehabilitation of people leaving prison and cut reoffending. • Transparency: Improving transparency by enabling all victims to request a transcript of court proceedings free of charge. 4. Police Accountability and Operations Policies are included to address public trust and improve specialized police responses. • Scrapping PCCs: Scrapping Police and Crime Commissioners and replacing them with local Police Boards made up of councillors and representatives from relevant local groups, investing the savings in frontline policing. • Improving Standards: Drawing up an urgent plan to implement the recommendations of the Baroness Casey Review to tackle sexism, racism, and homophobia, and encouraging other police forces to do the same. • Hillsborough Law: Introducing the Hillsborough Law, which establishes a statutory duty of candour on police officers and all public officials. • Mental Health Response: Improving the police response to mental ill-health by introducing a target of one hour for handover of people suffering from mental health crisis from police to mental health services, and ensuring a mental health professional is in the control room at all times. • Drug Policy: Moving the departmental lead on drugs policy from the Home Office to the Department of Health and Social Care. They propose diverting people arrested for possession of drugs for personal use into treatment where appropriate. They also plan to introduce a legal, regulated market for cannabis, restricted to over-18s, to tackle criminal gangs and remove \"skunk\" from the streets. 5. International Cooperation The manifesto stresses the importance of working with European neighbours to address cross-border crime. • International Crime: Improving cooperation with European neighbours on tackling cross-border crime, such as human trafficking, the illegal drug trade, cybercrime, and terrorism. • Data Sharing: Restoring direct, real-time access for UK police to EU-wide data sharing systems to identify and arrest traffickers, terrorists, and other international criminals. In essence, the policy summary indicates an overarching strategy of shifting resources to frontline community policing and rehabilitation while enhancing accountability and modernizing the handling of complex issues like mental health crises, fraud, and cross-border crime. The Liberal Democrats see these changes as necessary because the current Conservative approach has \"failed even to get the basics right,\" resulting in rising unsolved crimes and systemic crises in courts and prisons.",
          "healthcare": "The Liberal Democrat manifesto details an extensive plan to address the crisis in the National Health Service (NHS) and social care, emphasizing the importance of universal, high-quality healthcare that is free at the point of use. The party states that the crisis is currently characterized by long waiting times, staff retention issues, and failures in emergency services, arguing that the Conservative Government has \"plunged the NHS into crisis\". The overall strategy is aimed at tackling the crisis at the \"front door\" (early access) and the \"back door\" (social care) of the NHS, believing that fixing social care is essential to save the NHS. Here is a summary of the key policies on healthcare: 1. Improving Access and Targets The manifesto introduces specific rights and targets to improve immediate patient access: • GP Appointments: Giving everyone a new right to see a GP within seven days, or within 24 hours if they urgently need to. This will be delivered by increasing the number of full-time equivalent GPs by 8,000 (half through recruitment and half through retaining experienced GPs). • Named GPs: Everyone aged 70 or over, and anyone with long-term health conditions, will receive access to a named GP. • Dental Care: Guaranteeing access to an NHS dentist for everyone needing urgent and emergency care to end \"DIY dentistry and ‘dental deserts’\". Policies include fixing the broken NHS dental contract, providing supervised toothbrushing training for children, and scrapping VAT on children’s toothbrushes and toothpaste. • Cancer Treatment: Boosting cancer survival rates by introducing a guarantee that 100% of patients will start treatment within 62 days from urgent referral. They plan to recruit more cancer nurses and replace ageing radiotherapy machines. 2. Mental Health and Early Intervention The plan focuses heavily on improving mental health services, especially for young people: • School Professionals: Placing a dedicated, qualified mental health professional in every primary and secondary school. • Community Hubs and Check-ups: Opening walk-in hubs for children and young people in every community and offering regular mental health check-ups at key vulnerable points in people’s lives. • Young People’s Services: Extending young people’s mental health services up to the age of 25 to end the drop-off when transitioning to adult services. • Medication Costs: Making prescriptions for people with chronic mental health conditions free on the NHS. • Mental Health Act Reform: Modernising the Mental Health Act, strengthening people’s rights, and creating a statutory, independent Mental Health Commissioner. 3. Fixing Social Care to Relieve the NHS The Liberal Democrats acknowledge that \"fixing the crisis in social care to stop so many people being stuck in hospital beds\" is crucial for saving the NHS. • Free Personal Care: Introducing free personal care based on the model used in Scotland, ensuring provision is based on need, not ability to pay. • Workforce Support: Establishing a social care workforce plan, creating a Royal College of Care Workers, and introducing a higher Carer’s Minimum Wage. 4. Staffing, Ambulance Services, and Infrastructure To address the high number of staff vacancies and crumbling infrastructure : • Ambulance Service: Fixing the life-threatening crisis in ambulance services by ending excessive handover delays, primarily by increasing the number of staffed hospital beds and addressing the social care crisis. • NHS Staffing: Establishing a properly independent pay review body and implementing a ten-year retention plan. The party will also exempt NHS and care staff from the Immigration Skills Charge to help recruitment. • Infrastructure Investment: Implementing a ten-year plan to invest in hospitals and primary care estate to resolve the issue of crumbling buildings, dangerous concrete, and life-expired buildings. 5. Public Health and Prevention Policies are included to promote better long-term health and prevention: • Health Target: Setting a goal to help people spend five more years of their life in good health by investing in public health. • Tobacco Levy: Introducing a new levy on tobacco company profits to help fund healthcare and smoking cessation services. • Vaping and Food: Introducing regulations to halt the dangerous use of vapes by children, banning the sale of single-use vapes , and extending the soft drinks levy to juice-based and milk-based drinks high in added sugar. • Policy Lead: Moving the departmental lead on drugs policy from the Home Office to the Department of Health and Social Care. 6. Patient Rights and Accountability The party plans to enhance patient rights and tackle previous health scandals: • Patients Charter: Creating a new \"Patients Charter\" that includes a new legal right to a second opinion and a legal right to maintain contact in all health and care settings. • Infected Blood Inquiry: Committing to implement the recommendations of the Infected Blood Inquiry in full, delivering full and fair compensation to all victims in a timely manner. The Liberal Democrats argue that by investing in public health, early access to community services (GPs, dentists), and fixing social care, fewer people will need to go to the hospital, saving taxpayers’ money in the long run.",
          "housing": "The Liberal Democrat manifesto outlines a comprehensive strategy to tackle the housing crisis, focusing on increasing housing supply, reforming tenancy and ownership laws, and ending homelessness. Here is a summary of the key policies on housing, primarily found in Chapter 14 of the manifesto : 1.

The policies laid out in the four-stage roadmap are described as essential steps on the road to achieving this goal. 4.

They also propose a Sewage Tax on water company profits. • Climate Targets: Committing to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045 at the latest. • Energy and Insulation: Launching a ten-year emergency Home Energy Upgrade programme, starting with free insulation and heat pumps for those on low incomes. • Renewable Energy: Driving a rooftop solar revolution by expanding incentives and investing so that 90% of the UK’s electricity is generated from renewables by 2030. • Nature Recovery: Setting meaningful and binding targets to \"double nature\" by 2050, which includes doubling the Protected Area Network, doubling wildlife habitats, and planting at least 60 million trees a year. 4. A Strong United Kingdom and a Fair International Order The party promotes internationalism and seeks to restore the UK’s influence on the world stage, particularly by repairing relationships within Europe. Key policies include: • Europe Relations: Immediately fixing the broken relationship with Europe and moving to conclude a new comprehensive agreement to remove as many barriers to trade as possible. The longer-term objective remains EU membership. • Defense Spending: Maintaining support for NATO and increasing defence spending every year, with an ambition to spend at least 2.5% of GDP on defence. • Armed Forces: Reversing the Conservative cut to the Army, with a long-term goal of increasing regular troop numbers back to over 100,000. • International Aid: Restoring international development spending to 0.7% of national income. • International Law: Championing the liberal, rules-based international order. 5. A Truly Fair Democracy The Liberal Democrats aim to transform the nature of British politics by increasing representation, enhancing accountability, and shifting power away from Westminster. Key policies include: • Electoral Reform: Introducing proportional representation (Single Transferable Vote) for electing MPs and local councillors in England. • Accountability: Enshrining the Ministerial Code in law to demand higher standards of behaviour from Government Ministers. • Political Funding: Taking big money out of politics by capping donations to political parties. • Voting Rights: Giving 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote in UK general elections and referendums, and local elections in England. • Rights Protection: Championing the UK’s Human Rights Act and scrapping the Conservatives’ draconian anti-protest laws. Additionally, key policies address Housing, including increasing building to 380,000 new homes a year (including 150,000 social homes) , immediately banning no-fault evictions, and abolishing residential leaseholds. On Immigration and Asylum, they plan to scrap the Conservatives’ Illegal Migration Act and the Rwanda scheme, lift the ban on asylum seekers working after three months, and provide safe and legal routes to sanctuary."

          "crime": "The Alliance Party’s policies related to crime and justice, as detailed in their 2024 Westminster Manifesto, focus heavily on upholding the rule of law, reforming legacy mechanisms, addressing issues related to immigration exploitation, and funding the justice system adequately. Upholding the Rule of Law and Civil Liberties • Alliance champions human rights and the rule of law both domestically and internationally. They assert that human rights, equality, and the rule of law are cornerstones of safety and stability and must be defended robustly. • They advocate for reforming UK democracy by scrapping the Tories’ anti-protest laws. They will also demand the repeal of the Illegal Migration Act. • The party commits to restoring the rule of law, civil liberties, and equal access to justice. • They support the implementation of a Statutory Duty of Candour. Dealing with the Past (Legacy Justice) • Alliance believes that justice should have no time limit. • They advocate for the replacement of the Legacy Act with an alternative framework co-designed with local political parties and victims and survivors’ groups. They regard the current Legacy Act as a betrayal of previous agreements and at odds with justice and the rule of law. • They note that the criminal justice system should always be available to those seeking justice. • They support the campaign for a payment for those bereaved during the Troubles and previously supported the introduction and implementation of the Troubles Permanent Disablement Pension Scheme. Policing and Justice Funding • Alliance notes that the capacity to sustain and transform Northern Ireland’s justice system is hindered because Northern Ireland is not adequately funded to reflect relative need. • They identify policing and justice as key areas of public concern that require sufficient funding. • Alliance is committed to securing a base-lined fiscal floor for Northern Ireland set above 124% (relative to England), noting that the current calculation used to assess funding related to policing and justice needs may be inadequate because the period used for assessment was characterized by continuing cuts to the Department of Justice budget. Combating Exploitation and Trafficking • As part of their policy to overhaul the asylum system, Alliance commits to establishing safe, legal routes for asylum seekers to reduce exploitation and trafficking. • They argue that the current restrictive government approach has resulted in people being vulnerable to modern slavery, human trafficking, and exploitation. They believe the inability of asylum seekers to work causes vulnerability to criminal exploitation. • They support making changes to the visa system to end employer-dependent visas, so workers can change jobs or leave an exploitative employer. • They also aim to continue supporting the fight against modern slavery, human trafficking and criminal, labour, and sexual exploitation across the world. Specific Crime and Justice Reforms • Drug Policy: They will advocate for a Royal Commission on drug policy to ensure the adoption of evidence-based interventions, particularly those related to harm-reduction. • Animal Cruelty: Alliance seeks to tackle cruelty against animals and states that those who show brutality to animals are potentially a danger to society as a whole. They will continue to pursue high welfare standards and extend the ban on hunting mammals with dogs to Northern Ireland. • Online Safety: They call for better regulation of AI and social media and the establishment of a watchdog for child safety online. International and Economic Crime • Alliance seeks to implement the most robust economic crime legislation to prevent oligarchs from corrupt regimes from channeling money through the UK, with proceeds from seized Russian assets repurposed to support Ukraine. • They also support tackling tax-dodging which harms economies globally. • They seek deeper policing and justice co-operation between the UK and the EU, provided there is ongoing adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights.",
          "healthcare": "The Alliance Party’s policies on healthcare, as presented in the 2024 Westminster Manifesto, are primarily focused on addressing the systemic underfunding of public services in Northern Ireland (NI) and securing necessary investment to sustain and transform the region’s health system. Here is a summary of their key policies relating to health and care: Financial Support and Service Quality The party emphasizes that the ability to sustain and transform public services, including the health system, is severely hindered because Northern Ireland is not adequately funded to reflect its relative need. • Addressing Underfunding: Alliance seeks to secure an improved financial settlement for Northern Ireland that properly reflects relative need and allows for investment in public services. • Health Waiting Lists: They note that in the current fiscal climate, public services have been \"squeezed beyond recognition,\" leading to rising health waiting lists. • Fiscal Reform: They advocate for reforming UK fiscal rules to recognize the impact of public spending on the UK’s overall asset base, arguing this would help unlock vital investment in struggling public services. • Fairer Funding Floor: Alliance is committed to securing a base-lined fiscal floor set above 124% (relative to England) at the next UK Spending Review, believing the current funding level does not adequately reflect NI’s needs for areas like health, education, and justice. Specific Health and Care Policies • Health and Care Worker Visas: Alliance aims to support the health and social care sectors by reforming immigration policy. They seek to scrap the ban on dependents for those on a Health and Care Worker visa. • Infected Blood Scandal: They advocate for urgent, just compensation for all those affected by the Infected Blood Scandal, including scrutinizing the operation of the recently created Government compensation scheme. • Public Health Cooperation: They see opportunities to further develop cooperation in the area of public health through the British-Irish Council (East-West cooperation). • Duty of Candour: Alliance supports the introduction of a statutory Duty of Candour. Pandemic Preparedness Drawing lessons from recent outbreaks, Alliance advocates for better readiness for future health crises: • Mitigation and Management: They will advocate for better global cooperation from the next UK Government to mitigate and manage disease outbreaks with pandemic potential. • Health Service Support: They seek to ensure the health service and other key workers are better prepared and supported to meet the challenges of another pandemic. • Scientific Advice: They value expert scientific advice and believe it should inform government policy to help protect the population’s health during outbreaks. Overall, the Alliance Party aims to use its influence at Westminster to secure the necessary financial resources for Northern Ireland to ensure the stabilisation and subsequent transformation of its health and public service sectors.",
          "housing": "The Alliance Party’s Westminster Manifesto for July 2024 does not contain a dedicated section on housing policy. However, several commitments outlined in the document have direct implications for housing, particularly concerning energy efficiency, fuel poverty, and social housing provision, primarily within the context of Northern Ireland (NI) and the broader Green New Deal and migration policies. Here is a summary of the Alliance Party’s policies that relate to housing: 1. Retrofitting and Fuel Poverty A major commitment under the Alliance Party’s Green New Deal focuses on improving the energy efficiency of homes to tackle both climate change and the cost of living crisis. • Emergency Retrofitting Programme: They call for a UK-wide emergency retrofitting programme to reduce emissions and tackle fuel poverty. • Net Zero Carbon Buildings Standard: They support the continued development of the UK Net Zero Carbon Buildings Standard. • Reducing Energy Consumption: They commit to supporting a UK-wide emergency programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings. This includes providing insulation to cut emissions and fuel bills, retrofitting homes, and increasing energy efficiency of private rented sector homes and social housing, with the goal of ultimately ending fuel poverty for good. • Addressing the Energy Crisis: The party notes that an estimated 45% of homes in Northern Ireland may be living in fuel poverty, which they deem unacceptable, underscoring the need for massive investment in renewables and properly insulating homes. 2. Housing for Armed Forces and Asylum Seekers The manifesto touches on housing in the context of specific vulnerable groups: • Armed Forces Housing: Alliance commits to ensuring the provision of quality housing for armed forces personnel and their families. • Asylum Accommodation: As part of overhauling the asylum system, Alliance MPs will work to end the use of hotels and privatization of accommodation for those seeking asylum, moving instead to a not-for-profit-based system that is integrated into communities and works alongside social housing. • Homelessness Prevention: They advocate for making providers of asylum accommodation subject to a statutory duty to refer people leaving asylum support accommodation who are at risk of homelessness to the local housing authority. 3. Taxation and Wealth In the context of fiscal reform, Alliance advocates for property taxes on the super-rich as a way to raise public funds to support the transition to Net Zero, which would ultimately fund policies like the retrofitting programme affecting housing. To solidify understanding: Alliance’s approach to housing is like trying to fix an old, leaky ship (the current housing stock) by sealing up the holes and giving it a new engine (the Green New Deal). By focusing on energy efficiency and retrofitting, they aim to make the homes cheaper to run and environmentally sustainable, while also addressing specific acute needs for those in temporary accommodation or public service roles.",
          "immigration": "The Alliance Party’s Westminster Manifesto for July 2024 presents a clear and comprehensive agenda for migration, advocating for a fair, welcoming, and effective immigration system that both upholds human rights and meets the needs of the economy. The party unequivocally rejects the current anti-migrant rhetoric and the \"hostile environment\" approach, arguing that migration is a normal part of human life that enriches culture and significantly improves the economy. They note that key Northern Ireland sectors, such as retail, hospitality, agri-food, and social care, rely heavily on migrant workers, and the current restrictive policies have caused major job shortages. Alliance’s policies are divided into three main areas: reforming the visa system, overhauling the asylum system, and protecting the Common Travel Area (CTA). 1. Overhauling the Asylum System Alliance seeks to restore the universal right to seek asylum, arguing that the UK takes only a tiny fraction of the world’s refugees and that restrictive policies merely embolden smuggling gangs and expose people to exploitation. Key commitments include: • Repealing Legislation: Restoring the right to seek asylum by repealing the Illegal Migration Act 2023, the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, and the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024. • Abolishing Forced Resettlement: Abolishing the Rwanda Scheme and any other third-country forced resettlement agreements. • Establishing Safe Routes: Creating safe, legal routes to claim asylum in the UK, and expanding resettlement schemes to reduce the incentive for treacherous small boat journeys and subsequent exploitation and trafficking. • Right to Work: Granting asylum seekers the right to work in any job after three months so they can support themselves and their families and become active community members. • Accommodation: Ending the use of hotels and the privatization of accommodation, moving to a not-for-profit-based system that is integrated into communities and works alongside social housing. They also demand that accommodation providers have a statutory duty to refer people leaving asylum support who are at risk of homelessness to the local housing authority. • Processing: Ensuring asylum claims are processed fairly and quickly in a trauma-informed way. • Alternatives to Detention: Supporting a trial in Northern Ireland to explore community-based Alternatives to Detention (ATDs). 2. Reforming the Visa System Alliance MPs will campaign for changes to the visa system to make it more affordable and responsive to economic needs, particularly given the impact of current high thresholds on lower salary levels in Northern Ireland. Key reforms include: • Salary and Fees: Reversing the increased minimum threshold salary requirements for family visas and cutting extortionate visa fees. • Dependents and Families: Scrapping the ban on dependents for those on Health and Care Worker visas and student visas. • Ending Punitive Policies: Ending the punitive policy of No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF). • Economic Visa System: Repealing the Immigration Act 2020 to scrap the shortage occupation list and points-based system, replacing it with a system based on the real needs of the Northern Ireland economy and society. • Worker Protection: Ending employer-dependent visas to allow workers to change jobs or leave an exploitative employer. • Settlement and Students: Capping routes to settlement at five years of residence and granting overseas students two years to find work after graduation. 3. Protecting the Common Travel Area (CTA) Alliance seeks to preserve and enhance the free movement and reciprocal rights across the UK and Ireland under the CTA, noting that Brexit has placed it under growing stress. Their aims include: • Treaty Basis: Placing the CTA on a formal treaty basis by the UK and Irish Governments. • Non-EU/EEA Residents: Ensuring essential cross-border services and \"deemed permission\" to cross the border are provided to all lawfully resident non-EU/EEA citizens in Northern Ireland. • Tourism and Travel: Abolishing the requirement for non-EU/EEA citizens to carry passports when crossing the border and seeking an exemption for Northern Ireland tourism under the UK’s Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme. • Labour Mobility: Creating a labour mobility scheme on the island of Ireland.",
          "defence": "The Alliance Party’s policies on defence, as outlined in their 2024 Westminster Manifesto, are focused on supporting the armed forces, promoting international cooperation, reviewing defence spending, and adhering to international security norms. The policies fall under the chapter \"International Affairs and Defence\". Support for the Armed Forces Alliance respects and values the difficult work that our armed forces undertake and believes they must be properly remunerated and rewarded for their efforts. Specific commitments include: • Equipment Audit: Conducting an audit of the equipment and training provided to the armed forces to ensure they are adequately prepared for the various types of missions they face and that they have appropriate equipment for the changing natures of deployments. • Quality Housing: Ensuring the provision of quality housing for armed forces personnel and their families. • Armed Forces Covenant: Supporting the continuing implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant in Northern Ireland, including regular monitoring of the scheme. Defence Spending and International Cooperation Alliance commits to strengthening international security frameworks and ensuring defence policy reflects modern security challenges. Key points include: • NATO: Continuing to support NATO as the cornerstone of the defence of the UK and Europe. • Defence Review: Recognizing the need for the UK and other countries to increase defence spending and supporting a full defence review in this regard. • Cooperation with the EU: Advocating for stronger defence co-operation between the UK and the European Union and pushing for a formal agreement to be reached early in the forthcoming Parliament. • Defence Posture: Believing that changing the UK’s defence posture can yield savings. They suggest that other approaches, reflecting the security challenges of the future rather than the nuclear standoff of the Cold War era, can be used to ensure the UK’s security. • Nuclear Proliferation: Supporting the UK combating nuclear proliferation by leading by example in reducing nuclear weapons as part of agreed-upon multilateral efforts. Defence Procurement (Northern Ireland) Alliance specifically addresses how defence spending affects Northern Ireland: • Defence Contracts: They note that Northern Ireland currently receives the lowest share per capita in the United Kingdom of defence contracts. • Lobbying for Opportunities: Alliance will continue to lobby the Ministry of Defence to ensure that Northern Ireland-based companies have proper opportunities to compete for contracts and that the local SME sector can access related opportunities in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Military Intervention and Arms Exports In the broader context of international affairs, Alliance outlines principles for military engagement and arms control: • Military Intervention: They support military intervention only as a last resort. Any such intervention must be legal, have defined aims and an exit strategy, and be accompanied by non-military attempts at tackling the problem. They also accept that the “Responsibility to Protect” doctrine must be a factor in decision-making about intervention. • Arms Exports: They advocate for the creation of much higher scrutiny and restrictions on UK arms exports, ending exports to countries that engage in aggression against others and repression domestically. Alliance’s defence policy emphasizes that the UK’s security strategy should be modern, cooperative, and guided by international law, while ensuring that the armed forces are well-supported and that Northern Ireland businesses receive a fair share of defence opportunities.",
          "economy": "The Alliance Party’s economic policies, detailed in their 2024 Westminster Manifesto, center on securing fairer funding for Northern Ireland (NI), implementing a progressive taxation system, promoting a Green New Deal, and leveraging NI’s unique position under the Windsor Framework to foster an innovative and dynamic regional economy. Here is a summary of Alliance’s key economic policies: 1. Reforming UK Public Finances and Fiscal Policy Alliance argues that the current UK fiscal policy is inhibiting investment, reinforcing climate inaction, and hindering the capacity to sustain and transform public services. • Fiscal Rules Reform: They advocate for revising UK Fiscal Rules to account for the costs of environmental inaction and to enable necessary investment in climate action. They believe the rules should recognize the impact of public spending on the UK’s overall asset base (or wealth) rather than solely focusing on debt and deficit. This reform is seen as fiscally prudent if the spending creates additional net wealth, and it would unlock significant investment for public services, the economy, and the environment. • Progressive Taxation: Alliance calls for a progressive taxation system where the super-wealthy pay their fair share. They suggest revising the tax system to ensure it adequately captures and reflects wealth, noting that loopholes currently facilitate significant tax avoidance for the super-wealthy. They believe that increasing tax on the super-wealthy could allow for increased personal income tax allowances for hard-working individuals. • Carbon Taxes and Share Buybacks: They support the phased and proportionate implementation of carbon taxes in sectors like aviation and transport to incentivize emission reduction. Additionally, they seek a tax on share buybacks (such as those by oil and gas giants and big banks) to incentivize productive business investment, support the transition to Net Zero, and raise approximately £1.4 billion annually for public services. 2. Fairer Funding for Northern Ireland Alliance asserts that NI is currently structurally underfunded relative to its needs, harming public services and economic growth. • Improved Financial Settlement: A key priority is delivering an improved financial settlement for Northern Ireland that accurately reflects its relative need and allows for investment in public services and the economy. • Fiscal Floor: They are committed to securing a base-lined fiscal floor set above the current UK Government figure of 124% (relative to England) at the next UK Spending Review, believing this figure does not capture NI’s true relative need. • Cost of Division: Alliance advocates for new UK Government-funded research into the updated costs of division in NI (previously estimated between £400m and £800m annually) so that savings can be channeled back into public services. 3. Green New Deal and Economic Transformation Alliance views tackling the climate emergency and achieving economic transformation as interconnected goals. • Decarbonization and Jobs: They aim to create a Green New Deal to decarbonize the economy, protect workers, tackle fuel poverty, and create thousands of new jobs. • Investment Funding: The Green New Deal should be partly funded through tax increases on fossil fuel giants and the super-rich, property taxes, and long-term green bond issuance. • Retrofitting Programme: They call for a UK-wide emergency retrofitting programme to reduce emissions, tackle fuel poverty (affecting an estimated 45% of NI homes), and increase the energy efficiency of private rented and social housing. • Fossil Fuels: They commit to ending the use of fossil fuels, banning fracking, and prohibiting the opening of new coalmines and pits. 4. Northern Ireland Economy and Trade Alliance believes NI can become Europe’s most innovative and dynamic regional economy, capitalizing on its dual market access. • Dual Market Access: They will work to promote and exploit the opportunity of dual market access afforded by the Windsor Framework, which grants unfettered access to both the Great Britain and the Irish/EU markets for goods. • Regional Equality: They seek a legal duty placed on the UK Government to ensure its economic policies are assessed on their likelihood of reducing regional inequality and accelerating \"levelling up\". • SME Support: They advocate for supporting regional industries by boosting research, innovation, skills, infrastructure, and access to finance across the UK. They also want to see the expansion of the British Business Bank and the UK Infrastructure Bank to support viable small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in NI. • Apprenticeship Levy: Alliance supports a review of the Apprenticeship Levy and ensuring that any levy raised from Northern Ireland is ring-fenced for re-investment in skills. • Levelling Up Funds: They seek a fundamental review of the Levelling Up and Shared Prosperity Funds, arguing that resources and responsibility for these funds should be transferred to the NI Executive, as current funds are reduced and misaligned with local priorities. • Defence Contracts: They commit to lobbying the Ministry of Defence to ensure NI-based companies receive proper opportunities to compete for defence contracts, noting NI currently receives the lowest share per capita of these contracts. 5. Social Security and Welfare Alliance seeks a radical overhaul of the social security system to address the cost of living crisis. • Ending Punitive Measures: They support ending the Benefits Cap, Bedroom Tax, and the two-child limit on Child Benefit on a UK-wide basis. • Childcare Investment: They view childcare as key infrastructure to unlock current and future economic potential. They demand more generous tax relief through improvements to the UK’s Tax-Free Childcare scheme (e.g., increasing relief from 20% to 35%) and supporting a new childcare strategy for NI. • Carer’s Support: They support delivering a Carer’s Allowance Supplement and extending the Carer’s Allowance earnings threshold to recognize the contribution of unpaid carers. Alliance’s economic plan is essentially an \"invest-to-save\" strategy , aiming to address structural underfunding and climate risk through progressive taxation and fiscal reform, thereby stabilizing public services and maximizing Northern Ireland’s unique post-Brexit economic opportunities.",
          "education": "The Alliance Party’s policies on education, as outlined in their 2024 Westminster Manifesto, are focused primarily on securing funding for integrated and early years education in Northern Ireland (NI), and ensuring overall public services, including schools, are adequately funded. They also touch upon specific aspects of higher education and skills training. Here is a summary of Alliance’s key policies relating to education: 1. Funding for Shared and Integrated Education Alliance strongly advocates for policies that help build a \"shared future\" and reduce division in Northern Ireland. • Successor to Fresh Start Fund: They prioritize securing dedicated funding for integration, early years, and early intervention projects as a successor to the Fresh Start capital fund. • Expansion of Investment: This new fund should encompass the remaining integrated school projects that did not receive Fresh Start funding. Crucially, they propose expanding its scope to include investment in early years and early intervention. • Transformative Goal: This fund is intended to be transformative, collaborative, and focused on shared outcomes through trauma-informed projects, and would be additional to other funding streams like PeacePlus [41. • Transformative Goal: This fund is intended to be transformative, collaborative, and focused on shared outcomes through trauma-informed projects, and would be additional to other funding streams like PeacePlus. • Reducing Division Costs: They believe funding key projects such as integrated schools will help build a shared future. They also seek UK Government funding for research into the updated costs of division in NI (previously cited between £400m and £800m annually) so that savings from tackling division can be funneled back into public services. 2. General Public Service Funding Alliance maintains that the education system in Northern Ireland is facing significant financial constraints. • Inadequate School Budgets: They note that in the current fiscal climate, school budgets are inadequate to meet needs. • Fairer Financial Settlement: They commit to delivering an improved financial settlement for Northern Ireland that properly reflects its relative need, which is essential to sustain and transform the education system, alongside health and justice. • Fiscal Floor: They are committed to securing a base-lined fiscal floor for NI set above 124% (relative to England) to ensure equivalent funding based on relative underlying needs for public services like education. 3. Skills, Higher Education, and Apprenticeships Alliance addresses the connection between education, skills, and economic growth. • Review of Investment: They will advocate for a review of investment levels in skills, the funding model for colleges, universities, and apprenticeships, and student finance for England, noting that revised outcomes in these areas may have beneficial outcomes for Northern Ireland. • Apprenticeship Levy: They support a general review of the Apprenticeship Levy across the UK, and ensuring that any levy raised from Northern Ireland is ring-fenced for re-investment in skills. • Economic Strategy: They want strategic investment to ensure Northern Ireland has the skills and ability to attract greater levels of funding from projects like UK Research Councils and meet emerging labour market skills demands. • Migration and Qualifications: They commit to ensuring that migrants’ and refugees’ qualifications and prior learning are recognized to reflect need in the local economy and to ensure they can continue their education. • International Programmes: They support rejoining the Erasmus Plus programme so young people have full restored access to study, teach, and volunteer abroad. 4. Digital Safety and Child Welfare Alliance commits to protecting children and young people in the online space. • Online Safety Watchdog: They call for better regulation of AI and social media, including the establishment of an independent advocacy body for child safety online. • UN Convention: They support the incorporation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into UK law. • Global Education Rights: Alliance notes the importance of access to education, particularly for women and girls across the world, as a priority in their international affairs policy. Alliance’s overall education policy acts as a dual approach: campaigning at Westminster for structural financial reform to adequately fund existing services (like school budgets), while aggressively pursuing dedicated funds to break down sectarian barriers through integrated and early years provision.",
          "environment": "The Alliance Party’s environmental policies are central to their platform, structured around a comprehensive Green New Deal aimed at achieving Net Zero, tackling fuel poverty, and ensuring economic transformation. They advocate for significant fiscal and legislative reforms at the Westminster level to prioritize climate action. Here is a summary of Alliance’s key policies on the environment: 1. Fiscal and Economic Reform for Climate Action Alliance believes that current UK fiscal policy is reinforcing climate inaction and storing up environmental, social, and financial crises. • Revising Fiscal Rules: They prioritize revising UK Fiscal Rules to formally account for the costs of environmental inaction and to enable necessary investment in climate action. Alliance argues that the rules should recognize the impact of spending on the UK Government’s overall asset base (wealth), not just debt and deficit. This reform is intended to unlock significant investment for a Green New Deal and provide resilience against external risks like climate change. • Funding the Green New Deal: The Green New Deal should be funded through several progressive revenue streams, including: ◦ Tax increases on fossil fuel giants and the super-rich. ◦ Wealth and property taxes on the super-rich. ◦ Phased and proportionate carbon taxes in sectors like aviation and transport to incentivize emission reduction. They prefer a clear linkage between environmental taxes levied and investment in environmental improvement and tackling climate change. ◦ Long-term green bond issuance, ISAs, and pension funds. • Economic Strategy: Alliance seeks a legal duty placed on the UK Government to ensure its economic policies are assessed on their likelihood of reducing regional inequality. This strategic, targeted investment could unlock new skills, jobs, and technologies necessary for a greener economy. 2. Key Green New Deal Commitments The Alliance Green New Deal seeks to urgently decarbonize the economy, protect workers, and create jobs while upholding Net Zero targets. • Ending Fossil Fuels: They demand ending the use of fossil fuels. This includes an immediate ban on fracking and the opening of new coal mines and pits. They also support reversing new oil and gas licenses. • Decarbonizing Buildings and Tackling Fuel Poverty: They call for a UK-wide emergency retrofitting programme to reduce emissions and tackle fuel poverty. This includes: ◦ Providing insulation to cut emissions and fuel bills. ◦ Increasing energy efficiency of private rented sector homes and social housing, with the ultimate goal of ending fuel poverty for good. ◦ Supporting the continued development of the UK Net Zero Carbon Buildings Standard. ◦ Alliance notes that up to 45% of homes in Northern Ireland may be in fuel poverty, underscoring the urgency of investment in renewables and insulation. • Renewable Energy and Infrastructure: They will support massive investment in renewable energy to guard against price precarity, boost the industry in Northern Ireland, and ensure resilient infrastructure. 3. Regulatory, Transparency, and Conservation Measures Alliance policies extend to strengthening regulation, ensuring transparency, and tackling environmental harm. • Air Quality: They commit to introducing UK air quality limits in line with World Health Organisation levels to guarantee and monitor the right to breathe clean air both indoors and outdoors. • Enforcement: They call for enhanced funding for the Office of Environmental Protection (OEP) to ensure adequate enforcement and on-ground presence. • Transboundary Issues: They ensure the UK Government recognizes transboundary issues related to agriculture and the environment, including marine planning. • Emissions Trading: They want to ensure Northern Ireland receives its fair share of funding raised under the UK’s Emissions Trading Scheme. They also support merging of UK and EU emissions trading regimes (ETSs) and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAMs). • International Agreements: They support the UK’s urgent ratification of the UN Global Ocean Treaty and a ban on deep-sea mining. They also advocate for an ambitious UN Global Plastics Treaty. • Sustainable Supply Chains: They seek to prevent environmental and human rights abuses in supply chains by establishing due diligence obligations on UK companies. 4. International Climate Justice Alliance views climate change as a global justice issue, particularly affecting the Global South. • International Aid: They support restoring the commitment to spend 0.7% of the UK’s gross national income on Official Development Assistance. • Fossil Fuel Phaseout: They demand an end to all fossil fuel expansion globally and support a just transition to renewables, with high-income countries like the UK moving fastest. They also oppose all aid spending on fossil fuel production overseas, redirecting it toward international climate aid. • Loss and Damage: They support the establishment of the Loss and Damage Fund under the UNFCCC, ensuring the UK and fossil fuel companies pay their fair share. • Climate Finance: They commit to sustaining the UK’s pledge of £11.6 billion for climate finance, ensuring these funds are new and additional sources. Alliance’s environmental strategy is like tackling climate change with a financial hammer: by restructuring the UK’s fundamental economic rules to recognize environmental costs, they aim to generate the multi-trillion-pound investment needed to transition the UK economy to Net Zero, starting with making homes energy efficient and ending reliance on fossil fuels.",
          "brexit": "The Alliance Party’s policies on Brexit are rooted in their fundamental opposition to the decision, viewing it as \"fundamentally destructive\" for the UK as a whole, particularly posing challenges for Northern Ireland’s economy, environment, society, and political stability. Their strategy centers on repairing the UK-EU relationship, improving the implementation of the Windsor Framework, and ultimately advocating for the UK to return to the European Union. Here is a summary of Alliance’s policies on Brexit: 1. Position on Brexit and Future Relationship • Fundamental Opposition: Alliance was firmly opposed to Brexit, recognizing that some problems resulting from the UK’s departure \"will either persist or not be fully solvable\". • Ultimate Goal (Reversal): It remains Alliance’s policy that Northern Ireland and the UK should return to the European Union at an early opportunity. They believe only a full reversal of Brexit can resolve all the associated tensions, contradictions, and limitations. • Interim Alignment: In the interim, they seek closer alignment with the EU under the Trade and Co-operation Agreement, including considering rejoining the Single Market and Customs Union, arguing that this would ease the interface across the Irish Sea and soften the overall impact of Brexit. They also support the UK voluntarily aligning with the European Single Market pending formal agreements. 2. Implementing and Improving the Windsor Framework Alliance supports the special arrangements provided for under the Windsor Framework as a mitigation measure but acknowledges it is an imperfect solution, particularly as it fails to address the free movement of labour, services, and capital. Key actions to improve implementation include: • Veterinary Medicines Agreement: Negotiating a comprehensive Veterinary Medicines Agreement (or Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement) between the UK and the EU to significantly reduce the nature and level of related checks across the Irish Sea. Pending this agreement, they seek a grace period extension for the current Veterinary Medicines grace period, which ends on December 31, 2025. • Promoting Dual Market Access: Better promoting the opportunity of dual market access under the Windsor Framework, which gives NI unfettered access for goods to both the Great Britain and the Irish/EU markets. • \"Not for EU\" Labelling: Seeking a grace period to defer the next phase of goods labelling pending the conclusion of a comprehensive UK-EU Veterinary Agreement. • GB Business Support: Encouraging the UK Government to provide improved information and assistance to businesses based in Great Britain regarding trading with Northern Ireland to minimize trade friction. • Addressing the Democratic Deficit: Ensuring early and enhanced engagement between Northern Ireland’s elected representatives, Executive departments, and other stakeholders in the development of relevant EU law, as the Stormont Brake and Applicability Motions are \"blunt instruments\" that come at the end of the process. • Safeguarding Rights: Continuing to defend Article 2 of the Windsor Framework, which protects rights under the Good Friday Agreement and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), from any attack. They also commit to continuing the Windsor Framework in the forthcoming Democratic Consent vote. 3. Enhancing Cooperation Alliance advocates for stronger cooperation between the UK and the EU across various sectors: • North-South and East-West Cooperation: Enhancing cooperation through the Strand Two and Three institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, such as the North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) and the British Irish Council (BIC). They believe the NSMC could meaningfully drive cooperation on areas not covered by the Windsor Framework, such as services, capital, and the free movement of people. • Security and Justice: Seeking deeper policing and justice co-operation between the UK and the EU, provided there is ongoing adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). • Mobility and Professional Recognition: Advocating for a progressive return to freedom of movement, starting with specific cohorts like performers and a youth mobility scheme, and supporting Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications. They also support rejoining the Erasmus Plus programme. • Emissions Trading: Supporting the merging of UK and EU emissions trading regimes (ETSs) and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAMs). Alliance’s position is that stability in Northern Ireland depends on reconciling its deep interconnections with both Ireland (North-South) and the UK (East-West), and that maximizing flexibilities within the current arrangements requires continuous engagement and negotiated, legal changes agreed upon by both the UK and the EU.",
          "entire manifesto": "The Alliance Party’s Westminster Manifesto for July 2024 sets out a comprehensive agenda focused on institutional stability, economic fairness, climate action, and democratic reform, particularly emphasizing issues affecting Northern Ireland (NI). The manifesto identifies ten key policy priorities : 1. Reforming the Assembly and Executive so that no single party can hold the institutions \"to ransom\". 2. Delivering an improved financial settlement for Northern Ireland that accurately reflects the region’s relative need and allows investment in public services and the economy. 3. Revising fiscal rules to account for the costs of environmental inaction and to enable necessary investment in climate action. 4. Creating a Green New Deal to decarbonise the economy, protect workers, tackle fuel poverty, and generate thousands of new jobs. 5. Repairing the UK-EU relationship, which includes negotiating a comprehensive Veterinary Agreement and better promoting the opportunity of dual market access under the Windsor Framework. 6. Securing dedicated funding for integration, early years, and early intervention projects as a successor to the Fresh Start program, helping to build a shared future. 7. Supporting families with childcare costs by demanding more generous tax relief and the creation of a new childcare strategy for Northern Ireland. 8. Advocating for a fair, welcoming, and effective immigration system that upholds human rights and meets the needs of the economy. 9. Reforming UK democracy by scrapping the Tories’ anti-protest laws, abolishing the First Past the Post electoral system, and introducing votes at 16. 10. Championing human rights and the rule of law both domestically and internationally. Key Policy Areas in Detail Leading Change for Northern Ireland (Institutional and Legacy Reform) The Alliance Party believes that NI’s institutions must evolve, as they are currently held back by failures that lead to division and deadlock. • Institutional Reform: They aim to reform the process of nominating First and deputy First Ministers (to pass the entitlement to the next largest party if the largest is unwilling). They advocate replacing \"parallel consent\" in the Assembly with a weighted majority for cross-community votes and reforming the Petition of Concern mechanism. They also recommend changing the titles of the First and deputy First Ministers to \"Joint First Minister\" to acknowledge their co-equal offices, and ultimately abolishing the system of designations. • Legacy: The manifesto calls for the replacement of the Legacy Act with an alternative co-designed with local political parties and victims and survivors’ groups, asserting that justice should have no time limit. UK Public Finances and Taxation Alliance seeks major changes to the UK’s fiscal approach, arguing that current policy inhibits investment and reinforces climate inaction. • Fiscal Rules: They propose changing the UK Fiscal Rules to recognize the impact of spending on the overall asset base and wealth, rather than merely focusing on debt and deficit. This would unlock investment, particularly in areas mitigating environmental costs. • Taxation: They advocate for a progressive taxation system, where the super-wealthy pay their fair share, and the phased implementation of carbon taxes. They also support a tax on share buybacks to incentivize productive business investment. • Welfare: Alliance seeks a radical overhaul of the social security system. They support ending the Benefits Cap, Bedroom Tax, and the two-child limit on Child Benefit on a UK-wide basis. Economy and the Green New Deal Alliance seeks to position NI as Europe’s most innovative and dynamic regional economy, capitalizing on its unique dual market access. • Green New Deal: They support an urgent decarbonisation of the economy. Key commitments include ending the use of fossil fuels, banning fracking and new coal mines, funding the Green New Deal through taxes on fossil fuel giants and the super-rich, and launching a UK-wide emergency retrofitting programme to reduce emissions and tackle fuel poverty. • Economic Policy: They call for a legal duty on the UK Government to assess economic policies based on their likelihood of reducing regional inequality. They also seek a review of the Apprenticeship Levy, ensuring funds raised in NI are ring-fenced for re-investment in skills. Migration and Asylum Alliance rejects the current anti-migrant rhetoric and supports a compassionate, fair system. • Visa System Reform: They seek an overhaul of the visa system to make it more affordable, including removing cruel minimum threshold salary requirements for family visas. They also advocate scrapping the shortage occupation list and points-based system in favour of one based on NI’s real economic and societal needs. • Asylum: They commit to abolishing the Rwanda Scheme and restoring the universal right to seek asylum by repealing related legislation. They demand the creation of safe, legal routes for asylum seekers and granting asylum seekers the right to work in any job after three months. Relationship with the European Union Alliance was opposed to Brexit but is committed to making the Windsor Framework work better. • Fixing the Relationship: They believe the UK should ultimately return to the European Union (EU) to resolve the tensions of Brexit. Immediately, they seek closer alignment with the EU, including the negotiation of a comprehensive Veterinary Medicines Agreement to reduce checks across the Irish Sea. International Affairs Guided by liberal internationalist values, Alliance supports the rules-based international order. • International Development: They advocate for reinstating the Department for International Development (DFID) as a standalone department and restoring the commitment to spend 0.7% of the UK’s gross national income on Official Development Assistance. • Conflict: They support a two-state solution in the Middle East, based on international law, including the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state. They also maintain full support for Ukraine’s fight against Russian aggression and the ongoing provision of aid. The manifesto can be understood as a blueprint for change, seeking to unlock fairer funding and secure stable institutions to deliver a more sustainable and prosperous future for everyone in Northern Ireland."

Justice, Legacy, and Victims The SDLP’s overarching priority in this area is to ensure justice, truth, and accountability for victims. • Repeal the Legacy Act: The SDLP views the UK government’s toxic Legacy Act as an \"abhorrent amnesty\" and an act of serious bad faith . They successfully lobbied the UK Labour Party to commit to repealing this Act in the next Parliament, and SDLP MPs will hold the Labour Party accountable for that commitment. • Systemic Reforms: They advocate for substantive reforms to the criminal justice system to deliver faster, fairer justice with increased accountability. ◦ Focus on Rehabilitation: They call for further structural and staff reforms of the prison service to enhance rehabilitation, as well as the safety and dignity of both prison staff and prisoners. ◦ Community Mediation: They continue to call for a progressive approach, including support for community mediation methods and non-court approaches of dispute resolution. ◦ Reduce Re-offending: They support establishing a 12-month post-release supervision program, following international best practice models, to help reduce re-offending. ◦ Protect Victims’ Rights: Systemic reforms should be introduced to protect the rights of victims, including an effective communication strategy to raise awareness of the Victim and Witnesses Charters and access to support services and entitlements. ◦ Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA): They support the full implementation of the remaining recommendations from the HIA Inquiry and the release of redress payments and other required support to survivors. 2. Policing and Paramilitarism The manifesto details commitments to visible policing, combating specific crimes, and greater cooperation across the island. • Visible Police Presence: SDLP MPs will always lobby for a visible police presence in communities, which they state has been hollowed out by a decade of Tory austerity. They aim to ensure that no community is managed by \"gatekeepers\" who exercise undue influence. • Police Representation: They will continue to challenge the PSNI on recruitment, retention, and promotion policies, particularly concerning underrepresented groups. They believe the recruitment of officers and civilian staff from the Catholic tradition is a pressing challenge that requires the deployment of every measure, including affirmative action. • Combating Cybercrime: They will work with relevant authorities, including the PSNI’s Chief Constable and the Northern Ireland Policing Board, to ensure that the police service is modern and equipped to combat online crime, including cybercrime, economic crime, and fraud . • Tackling Paramilitarism: They seek to end paramilitarism and associated criminality. ◦ They will ensure the Paramilitary Disbandment Strategy Panel is provided with necessary support and information from organizations including the PSNI, An Garda Síochána, and other stakeholders [8LP:82]. ◦ They advocate for greater cooperation between the PSNI and An Garda Síochána to deal with crime associated with the border. ◦ They call for stronger collaboration between relevant agencies to deliver a specific anti-corruption strategy for Northern Ireland and a significant uplift in resources, having fought for local oversight and robust accountability protections for the National Crime Agency. 3. Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) The SDLP is committed to the full implementation and funding of the new Ending Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy. • Reverse Cuts to Women’s Aid: They will lobby the Executive Office repeatedly to reverse the cut to Women’s Aid NI, describing the current situation—where Women’s Aid NI is the only part of Women’s Aid across the UK without state funding—as \"totally indefensible\". • Legislation Implementation: They will hold the Department of Justice responsible for the limited provision of implementation, training, or monitoring for new legislation on areas like domestic abuse and stalking, and will press for the implementation of all recommendations from the Gillen Review. • Family Courts Review: They believe a review of the family courts system is required, similar to the one undertaken in England, and will work to ensure this review is delivered urgently. 4. Hate Crime and Disability Rights • Hate Crime Legislation: They support robust standalone hate crime legislation to end these crimes, as recommended by the Marrinan Review, and will seek to hold the Justice Minister accountable for a previous commitment to this. • Disability Hate Crime: They will continue to campaign against the negative attitudes and discrimination that affect disabled people, including through addressing disability hate crime. • Asylum Seekers: They commit to standing against hate crime and discrimination wherever it occurs in any community.",
          "healthcare": "The SDLP Manifesto for Westminster 2024 emphasizes the urgent need to rescue public services, particularly the health service, which is described as being \"on life support\" and already collapsing due to years of austerity and governmental instability.

This includes supporting health service staff in their campaign for fair pay and safe staffing levels by making representations directly to the Treasury. • GP Support: They will argue for a government-backed indemnity scheme for GPs in Northern Ireland to avert the unnecessary closure of local practices. • Multi-Disciplinary Teams (MDTs): They will fight for the expansion of Multi-Disciplinary Teams across Northern Ireland. • Stalled Transformation Agenda: The manifesto notes that the Transformation agenda has stalled due to the constant collapse of government, a failure to fund strategic change, and a lack of political will, leading to service withdrawal and eroded confidence in the transformation program. 2. General Public Service Funding The SDLP recognizes that broader fiscal policies are necessary to rescue the health service and other public services. • Ending Austerity: They seek to put an end to the politics of austerity. They will press for real investment in public services to undo the impact of austerity. • Improved Financial Settlement: SDLP MPs will advocate for an improved financial settlement that recognizes decades of underfunding. • Comprehensive Spending Review: They will press for a comprehensive spending review which allows the Executive to deliver a multi-year, costed public service recovery plan. • Public Sector Pay: They will fight for a fair deal for public sector workers, acknowledging years of underinvestment. 3.

They note that without unpaid carers, the health and social care system would simply collapse. • Mental Health: They include Health, Mental Health & Well-Being as one of the 12 key policy areas for long-term development via the New Ireland Commission. • Disability Rights: They support full and equal access to public services, including healthcare, for disabled people and call for investment to address the impact of the cost-of-living crisis and the pandemic on disabled individuals. • Asylum Seekers: They commit to promoting equal opportunities for integration, including access to health, education, housing, and fair employment for all in the community. The overall objective is to move beyond the current crisis, where people have been forced to take out loans for private healthcare , and deliver a plan to rescue public services.",
          "housing": "The key policies and related issues on housing and infrastructure are: Addressing the Housing Crisis and Poverty • Growing Waiting Lists: The collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive for five of the last seven years has led to an \"unprecedented decline in public services,\" resulting in growing housing waiting lists. • Housing and Poverty: The costs associated with rent and mortgages have forced more and more people into poverty in recent years. The SDLP notes hearing first-hand accounts of young people who cannot afford to buy their first home and those on the property ladder struggling with \"sky high mortgage prices\". • Accountability for Delivery: The SDLP will hold the Minister for Communities responsible for the failure to build the appropriate level of housing, including social homes. • Funding the Crisis: Although housing is a devolved matter, SDLP MPs commit to fighting to ensure that appropriate funding is made available to the Northern Ireland Executive to address the housing crisis. Infrastructure and Planning Related to Housing • Water Infrastructure Constraint: The construction of 19,000 homes across Northern Ireland is currently at risk due to a lack of necessary water and sewerage infrastructure. This issue has placed a \"stranglehold\" on the economy and the building of homes. ◦ The SDLP recognizes the urgent need to address the legacy of underfunding in NI Water. ◦ They are opposed to water charges and argue that the Executive must prioritize investment in critical water infrastructure through alternative means, rather than imposing further hardship on families. • Planning Reform: The SDLP will seek to reform the planning system by: ◦ Prioritizing and expediting large-scale housing developments. ◦ Streamlining the planning process and addressing current backlogs. ◦ Ensuring alignment of planning policies with broader economic, social, and environmental objectives to promote balanced and sustainable development. • Associated Infrastructure: The manifesto notes that the completion of the A6 road is a critical infrastructure project, particularly given the additional plans for housing developments in the region. • Flood Risk: Approximately 45,000 properties in Northern Ireland are at risk of flooding, a number expected to increase significantly due to climate change. The SDLP believes the Executive has failed to manage this situation and calls for improved warning systems to ensure communities are better prepared. • Integration: The SDLP promotes equal opportunities for the integration of asylum seekers and refugees, including access to health, education, and housing. • Disability Access: They call for investment to ensure that the built environment of local communities is fully accessible to disabled people, which includes homes.",

Related Security and Paramilitarism Policies While not strictly defense, the manifesto details policies related to internal security and paramilitary issues: • Tackling Paramilitarism: The party seeks to end paramilitarism and associated criminality.

Primary and Secondary Education The SDLP’s policies focus on securing resources, improving staff pay, reducing costs for families, and supporting inclusive education models: • Fair Pay for Staff: The SDLP believes that teachers have not been appreciated by successive Education Ministers. They argue for an increase in pay above inflation for teachers and school-based support staff.

They support the recent Integrated Education Act and will continue to promote integrated education, including holding the Executive accountable for the implementation of that legislation. They previously led the opposition to the Executive and UK Government’s decision to remove £150 million of ringfenced funding for integrated education. 2. Language and Curriculum Support • Irish Language Sector: The SDLP strongly supports the Irish language sector, including ensuring that Irish-medium education is fully supported. • Irish Language Rights: They support the development of a Bill for Irish Medium Education to clarify and strengthen the current statutory duty and ensure policies and services are in place to meet the needs and growth of the sector, including supporting workforce development and recruitment. • Languages in School: They support the inclusion of languages as a compulsory subject for study at GCSE level to reverse the decline in pupils studying languages in school. • LGBTQIA+ Education: They support promoting age-appropriate and expert-guided LGBTQIA+ inclusive relationships and sexuality education for schools. • Arts and Culture: They support the delivery of a new Arts, Culture and Heritage Strategy and will specifically lobby Westminster to provide additional funding to the Executive for the Arts Council NI to provide Artsmark accreditation in Northern Ireland. 3. Higher and Further Education (Skills Investment) The SDLP views skills as the \"engine of our economy\" and is committed to defending education as a public good. • Magee University Expansion: They will fight for a full-size university campus at Magee of at least 10,000 students. The SDLP has already secured funding for expansion and development of the Medical School in the North West and supports specific financial incentives for students to study at Magee. They seek to establish a cross-border oversight body for higher education in the North West, in line with the recommendations of the Royal Irish Academy. • Lifting the Student Cap: They will fight to lift the Maximum Student Numbers (MaSN) cap in Northern Ireland, viewing it as an arbitrary cap on ambition and a barrier to skills development. • Higher Education Funding Review: They support a fundamental review of Higher Education funding, including student fees and teaching grants, to ensure no student is disadvantaged because of costs, including at postgraduate level. • Further Education (FE): They support a new approach to third-level education that creates a skills pipeline and ensures parity of esteem between the further and higher education sectors.

          "environment": "The SDLP Manifesto places significant focus on environmental protection, tackling the climate crisis and biodiversity loss, ensuring a just transition to a low-carbon economy, and prioritizing infrastructure necessary for ecological health, particularly concerning water quality. Here is a summary of the key policies on the environment: 1. Climate Legislation and Governance The SDLP is committed to supporting ambitious environmental and climate legislation at Westminster and establishing dedicated independent agencies in Northern Ireland. • Support for Ambitious Legislation: SDLP MPs will always support ambitious climate legislation at Westminster. They previously supported the Climate & Nature Bill, which aims to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reverse biodiversity loss, and build consensus for a just transition. • Net Zero and Green Levy: Colum Eastwood tabled pioneering climate legislation in the last Westminster mandate that would have introduced tougher net zero commitments and created a new green jobs levy on large corporations to fund climate mitigation and a just transition to a low carbon economy. SDLP MPs will press a new government to include these proposals in a new Green Prosperity Plan. • Well-being of Future Generations Bill: They will support a \"Well-being of Future Generations Bill\" aimed at improving the social, economic, environmental, and cultural well-being of people in Northern Ireland. • Independent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): The SDLP will campaign for an Independent Environmental Protection Agency to be established, as recommended in 2007 and agreed in the New Decade New Approach agreement in 2020. The SDLP also secured support in the Assembly in May 2024 for the establishment of an independent EPA by the end of this Assembly mandate. A key role of this EPA would be to prioritize improvement in the status of rivers, lakes, transitional, and coastal water bodies. 2. Water Quality and Natural Environment Addressing water pollution and risks to natural habitats is a central plank of the SDLP’s environmental agenda. • Lough Neagh Recovery Plan: They demand a properly funded plan of action to address the ecological crisis in Lough Neagh. Steps in this plan must include: ◦ Upgrading the Wastewater Treatment Works around Lough Neagh. ◦ Introducing unannounced sampling of water. ◦ Enforcing existing regulation on pollution with fines when necessary. ◦ Increasing inspections of farms. • Water Infrastructure: They require adequate investment to upgrade water infrastructure to prevent the risk of overspill and pollution into the environment. The current system is not fit for purpose and cannot meet new environmental standards or public demand. • Opposition to Water Charges: The SDLP is opposed to water charges and prevented their introduction in government. They argue that the Executive must prioritize investment in critical water infrastructure through alternative means, rather than imposing domestic charging. • Water Risk to Housing: They are deeply concerned that the construction of 19,000 homes is currently at risk due to a lack of water/sewerage infrastructure. 3. Climate Adaptation and Transition Policies focusing on fair transitions, clean air, and managing climate risks: • Just Transition: The SDLP will continue to hold government at Stormont and Westminster responsible for the delivery of a Just Transition. This includes ensuring it is a central tenet of all climate action plans by Executive Departments. ◦ They note that a Just Transition Fund for Agriculture has yet to be established. ◦ A Just Transition Commission is still to be established to support all sectors of the economy in meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets. • Sustainable Farming: They will work to ensure that new funding streams properly support farmers and are used to encourage the development of environmentally sustainable farming methods that support biodiversity. • Clean Air Act: They will support an ambitious new Clean Air Act with clear goals to reduce particulate matter to 10 micrograms per cubic metre as soon as possible, but no later than 2030, with stretch targets for further reduction in PM2.5 levels. They will also advocate for clean air filtration guidance for the public sector. • Flood Risk: Recognizing that 45,000 properties are at risk of flooding, a number expected to increase significantly due to climate change, they call for improved warning systems to ensure communities are better prepared. • Animal Cruelty Register: They support the introduction of an all-island animal cruelty register to prevent known animal abusers from buying or owning animals in another part of the island. 4. Sustainable Infrastructure and Planning • Public Transport: Investing in the public transport network is seen as a crucial lever to help combat the climate emergency and create sustainable communities. They have a strong record of investment in zero-emission buses. • Electric Vehicles (EV): They will push for the delivery of the EV Infrastructure Action Plan being developed by the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Taskforce, ensuring equitable access within the network. • Planning Reform: They will seek to ensure that planning policies are aligned with broader environmental objectives to promote sustainable development. They also advocate for planning reform to prioritize climate change adaptation/projects. The SDLP views unchecked global temperature increases, climate breakdown, and the biodiversity crisis as an urgent necessity and a generational injustice. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The SDLP’s environmental policy can be viewed as tackling two main pillars simultaneously: mitigation (through promoting green jobs levies, net zero, and climate legislation) and adaptation/restoration (through addressing failing infrastructure, water quality, and biodiversity loss, particularly in sensitive areas like Lough Neagh). ",
          "brexit": "The SDLP Manifesto views the UK’s departure from the European Union (EU) as a major failure of the Conservative government, stating that a \"pathological obsession with leaving the European Union has severed our links to one of the world’s largest markets leaving people, community groups and businesses far worse off\". The party’s key policies on Brexit focus on leveraging Northern Ireland’s unique trading status, restoring a voice in Europe, and planning for future re-accession in the context of unification. Here is a summary of the key policies on Brexit and the European Union: 1. Maximizing Dual-Market Access (The Protocol/Windsor Framework) The SDLP advocates for maximizing the competitive advantages of Northern Ireland’s unique status, which places it at the crossroads of two major markets (the UK and the EU). • Tailored Strategy: The party supports creating a strategy tailored to the sectors that have the most to gain from the Protocol/Windsor Framework. • Funding and Buy-in: This strategy should be co-developed with buy-in and funding from the Irish and British governments and the European Union. • European Investment Hub: The SDLP presses for the creation of a new \"European Investment Hub\" for Northern Ireland and increased funding for InterTrade Ireland to support a strong all-island economy. • European Commission Office: They will lobby for an office of the European Commission in Belfast to deepen economic and social ties between the European Union and Northern Ireland. • Trade Compliance: They commit to ensuring compliance with Article 2 of the Windsor Framework on the non-diminution of human rights following the UK’s departure from the EU. 2. Restoring Northern Ireland’s Voice in Europe The party seeks to address the democratic deficit caused by the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. • MEPs Restoration: The SDLP supports the restoration of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) for Northern Ireland to help address the democratic deficit. They note this move is supported by a large majority (over 70%) of the NI public. • Representation Agreement: They will work towards an agreement for elected representation from Northern Ireland in the European Union to restore its voice. • Assembly Structures: They support enhancing representation through new structures, including: ◦ A new dedicated European Affairs Committee in the Northern Ireland Assembly, with powers to take evidence from UK Ministers and EU officials. ◦ Annual meetings in Belfast of the EU-UK Parliamentary Assembly. ◦ An enhanced role for the North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in EU affairs. • Voting Rights: They support the right of Irish citizens living in other countries to vote for Irish candidates in European elections. 3. Planning for Re-accession in the Context of Unification The SDLP is a proudly pro-European and internationalist party that believes the centrality of the European Union is vital to the peace process. They affirmed that the only viable route back into the EU is a new and agreed Ireland. • New Conversation: The SDLP affirms that now is the time for a new conversation on the future of the island in Europe. • Dedicated Process: The party is calling for a dedicated process to be put in place by the European Union to plan for Northern Ireland’s re-accession into the European Union in the context of unification. • Good Friday Agreement Commitment: They aim to fulfill the commitment in the Good Friday Agreement to \"develop still further the unique relationship between their peoples and the close cooperation between their countries as friendly neighbours and as partners in the European Union\". The SDLP has historically been among the most ardent opponents of the decision to leave the EU in 2016. They believe that more people across Northern Ireland have reflected on a shared European identity since the vote.",
          "entire manifesto": "The SDLP Manifesto for Westminster 2024 outlines several priorities for change, focusing broadly on ending austerity, strengthening public services, reforming governance, and advocating for specific international and economic goals. The manifesto identifies the following seven key priorities: 1. A New Start – Remove the Conservative Government from power. 2. Better Public Services for All – Reduce hospital waiting lists with additional investment in health. 3. Improved Funding Model for NI. 4. Repeal the Legacy Act. 5. A Fairer Economy for All. 6. Recognise the State of Palestine and end arms exports to Israel. 7. Restore nature and support a just transition. Detailed Policy Areas 1. Governance and Political Reform (A New Start) The SDLP MPs commit to using their votes to ensure there is no Conservative Government. They also seek reform of the devolved institutions to prevent the veto of government and the decline in public services. Key reforms include: • Seeking to initiate a review of the operation of devolution under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. • Pressing for reform that prevents one party from collapsing devolution and removes the veto while maintaining power-sharing principles. • Supporting the return of joint nomination and election of the First Ministers. • Changing the election of the Speaker to a two-thirds majority rather than a double majority. 2. Rescuing Public Services (Health, Funding, and Pay) The manifesto advocates for an improved financial settlement for Northern Ireland to undo the impact of austerity and recognize decades of underfunding. • Financial & Fiscal Policy: They will press for a comprehensive spending review allowing the Executive to deliver multi-year, costed public service recovery plans. They seek the devolution of further fiscal powers, specifically Tourism and Hospitality VAT, the Apprenticeship Levy, and Air Passenger Duty. • Cost of Living: SDLP MPs will support a new government’s plan to levy a windfall tax on oil and gas giants. They previously introduced legislation for a green jobs levy on large corporations to fund a just transition. • Public Sector Pay: The SDLP will fight for a fair deal for public sector workers, supporting above-inflation pay increases for teachers and school support staff, and seeking pay parity between Further Education Lecturers and school teaching staff. • Health Service: They will make representations to the Treasury for a health service transformation intervention. They will seek dedicated resources to reduce waiting lists, which currently affect over half a million people (more than 1 in 4 of the population). They also argue for a government-backed indemnity scheme for GPs. • Education: They advocate for fair pay for teachers and staff, proper resourcing to tackle Educational Underachievement, and a complete overhaul of the Special Educational Needs (SEN) system. They support a cap on school uniform costs and continued progress on integrated education. 3. A Fairer Economy For All The SDLP seeks a prosperous, world-leading, and regionally equitable economy. • Dual-Market Access: They intend to maximize the competitive advantages of the Protocol/Windsor Framework by developing a tailored strategy with funding from both the Irish and British governments and the European Union. • Poverty and Welfare: They will lobby for the publication and funding of a robust Anti-Poverty Strategy. They demand that the next UK government ensures an Essentials Guarantee within Universal Credit. They also seek to reverse the punitive decision on WASPI women (Women Against State Pension Inequality) and reduce the State Pension Age. • Small Business Support: They will work to increase the VAT threshold to £100,000 and support the automatic uprating of the Employment Allowance. • Skills and Education: They will fight for a full-size university campus at Magee of at least 10,000 students and support lifting the Maximum Student Numbers (MaSN) cap in Northern Ireland. • Workers’ Rights: The SDLP supports an end to zero-hour contracts, a campaign for an equal minimum wage (to prevent discrimination against young people), and ensuring flexible working is a day-one right. They also support the introduction of at least five days of paid carers’ leave. 4. Justice, Equality, and Rights The overriding priority in the area of Justice is to Repeal the Legacy Act, which they opposed as an abhorrent amnesty. • Systemic Reforms: They call for structural and staff reforms of the prison service to enhance rehabilitation. • Policing and Paramilitarism: They will lobby for a visible police presence. They seek greater cooperation between the PSNI and An Garda Síochána to deal with border-associated crime and support the implementation of the Paramilitary Disbandment Strategy Panel. • Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG): They will lobby the Executive Office to reverse the cut to Women’s Aid NI. • Rights: They commit to ensuring a comprehensive ban on conversion practices and providing gender-affirming healthcare services for the LGBT+ population. They also support the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities. • Irish Language Rights: They will work to ensure the appointment of Commissioners and establishment of bodies provided for under the Identity and Language Act 2022. 5. Climate and Infrastructure The SDLP will support ambitious climate legislation at Westminster. • Environment: They will campaign for an independent Environmental Protection Agency and fight for a Lough Neagh Recovery Plan, including upgrading Wastewater Treatment Works and enforcing pollution regulations. They also advocate for an all-island animal cruelty register and a new Clean Air Act. • Infrastructure: They will fight to ensure funding for the delivery of the A5 and advocate for the completion of the A6. They will push for progress on the delivery of the All Island strategic Rail Review. The SDLP is opposed to water charges and advocates that the Executive prioritize investment in critical water infrastructure through alternative means. 6. Our Place In The World The SDLP is a proudly internationalist party and a member of the Party of European Socialists. • Gaza: They are appalled at the ongoing situation in Gaza. They will continue to call for an Immediate Ceasefire, Recognition of the State of Palestine, and an end to the funding of Israeli arms. They support a Palestinian Visa Scheme for safe passage out of Gaza. • Refugees and Asylum: They commit to transforming the asylum system, including by repealing anti-asylum seeker legislation introduced by the Conservative government (like the Safety of Rwanda Act). They will lobby to end the ban on asylum seekers working. • Europe: They affirm the time is right for a new conversation on the future of the island in Europe. They are calling for a dedicated process to be put in place by the European Union to plan for Northern Ireland’s re-accession into the EU in the context of unification. They also support the restoration of Members of the European Parliament for Northern Ireland. The SDLP sees this election as a chance to end the politics of austerity, isolation, and division that they claim have driven governments for 14 brutal years."

        {
          "crime": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s manifesto outlines several key policies focused on reforming the justice system, strengthening policing, addressing serious crime, and dealing with legacy issues stemming from the Troubles. Policing and Administration of Justice The party asserts that the Policing and Justice system in Northern Ireland has been mismanaged, poorly resourced, and badly understood since devolution in 2010. • Police Headcount and Recruitment: They are steadfast in their support for delivering a police officer headcount of 7,500. They propose recruiting 500 additional police officers over the next 3 years, beyond normal replenishment. • Officer Attestation: Police Officers should attest at the start of their training, becoming legally appointed from their first day, aligning with practices in the rest of the United Kingdom. • Speeding Up Justice: They note that justice takes twice as long through Northern Ireland courts compared to the rest of the UK, which detrimentally affects victims and witnesses. They will work to speed up the administration of justice and reduce the time between arrest and sentencing. • Addressing Race-Related Intimidation: The UUP will support the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and civic society to address and end race-related intimidation and discrimination. • Zero-Tolerance for Hate Crimes: They commit to implementing a zero-tolerance approach to hate crimes. Sentencing and Offenders The party believes sentencing structures are broken, leading to a lack of public confidence in the justice system. • Stronger Sentences: They will press for stronger sentences, particularly for habitual, violent re-offenders. • Review of 50/50 Sentences: They will campaign for a review of the near mandatory practice of giving serious offenders a 50/50 custodial sentence (allowing only half of the sentence to be served). • Guilty Pleas and Reduced Sentences: They propose that the practice of a perpetrator admitting guilt on the last day of a trial to receive a reduced sentence must be stopped, meaning longer time spent behind bars. • Prison Resources and Remand: They want the Prison Service to be given the resources it needs, including a workforce that is fit for purpose. They will also seek to reduce the number of people held on remand by speeding up justice and introducing alternative methods like electronic tagging (as used in England). Victims and Legal System Reform • Standing By Victims: They believe victims are often regarded as an afterthought and need a change in culture within the justice system where the State is seen to fulfill its duty of protecting law-abiding citizens. They stress that witnesses must be kept engaged to ensure continuity of evidence and maximize positive outcomes. • Legal Aid and Lawfare: They aim for more progress in reducing the legal aid bill, which costs over £90 million a year. The UUP has called for a comprehensive review of legal aid in Northern Ireland (which they state is the most generous in the UK). They suggest all reform options, including capping the legal aid bill, should be considered. Organized Crime and Illegal Immigration • Challenging Organized Crime: The party commits to challenging organized criminal gangs (including those regarded as paramilitary or terrorist in nature) which plague communities with serious criminal activity, such as drug dealing. They demand a concerted effort against the leadership of such groups, focusing on arrests and seizure of assets to reassure the public that \"crime really does not pay\". • Illegal Immigration: The UUP will implement a zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration. They will support government measures to target people traffickers through cooperation with other European countries. Legacy Issues (Troubles-Related Crime) The UUP remains dedicated to achieving justice and accountability for victims of Troubles-related crimes. • Opposition to Legacy Act: They remain opposed to the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act because it denies justice for victims and grants amnesty to perpetrators. They also oppose any return to the Stormont House Agreement Legacy proposals. • PSNI Legacy Investigation Branch (LIB): They support the funding and expansion of the PSNI Legacy Investigation Branch to deal with all Troubles-related crime, including murder, attempted murder, sexual crimes, and assaults. They propose this branch be enhanced by increasing qualified homicide investigators, funded by Westminster. • Public Prosecution Service (PPS) Split: They advocate for splitting the Public Prosecution Service into two sections: one for normal workload and a second dealing purely with legacy issues, with the latter funded by Westminster.",
          "healthcare": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto outlines its commitments for the health and social care system, aiming to build a responsive, accessible,The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto outlines its commitments for the health and social care system, aiming to build a responsive, accessible, quality system, despite facing severe financial challenges. Current State and Financial Challenges • The UUP states its overall aim is to build a world-leading health and social care system that is responsive, accessible and delivers quality care. • While the system is fortunate to be free at the point of delivery, just as the NHS was originally envisioned, the system is currently not functioning as it should. • Key issues include wholly unacceptable waiting times, demand outstripping capacity, and challenges in the recruitment and retention of sufficient Health and Social Care (HSC) workers. • The party demonstrated its commitment to making health and well-being its number one priority by taking on the Department of Health, which is described as undoubtedly the most difficult job in the Northern Ireland Executive. • The system is currently facing unprecedented challenges due to the devastating financial implications of the 2024/25 Budget allocation, which is delivering a record £184m cut in funding. • The UUP Minister of Health has sought to deliver stability and is working to implement difficult savings, but a shortfall in the budget remains. The party will not take drastic actions, such as making thousands of health workers redundant or closing the equivalent of a large hospital, as this would inflict suffering and harm on patients. • The health service needs sustainable multi-year investment to deliver intended benefits for patients and the wider system. Key Policy Commitments for Health and Social Care The UUP’s commitments are centered on transforming service delivery, supporting staff, and empowering primary care: 1. Service Transformation and Elective Care: ◦ The party commits to continuing to transform services to meet population needs. ◦ This transformation includes the identification of the next Elective Overnight Stay Centre. ◦ They will continue to commission activity in Day Procedure Centres and support the continued expansion and utilisation of mega-clinics. ◦ These efforts will be supported by the publication of a HSC reconfiguration blueprint, a multi-year plan, and the ongoing implementation of the elective care framework, mental health strategy, and cancer strategy. ◦ While waiting times remain intolerable, the manifesto notes tangible improvements have begun across many specialties, including noticeable reductions in treatment waiting times for General Surgery (-21%), Trauma and Orthopaedic surgery (-8%), ENT (-16%), Gynaecology (-22%), and Urology (-10%). 2. Workforce Support and Pay Parity: ◦ The UUP commits to its long-standing policy of maintaining pay parity for health and social care staff. ◦ They will continue to engage with Executive colleagues to ensure that independent pay recommendations are funded and delivered as quickly as possible. ◦ To achieve savings, they will accelerate progress in reducing the most expensive forms of agency staff and will introduce a new framework to limit hugely expensive off-contract medical and locum costs, following the successful ban on off-contract nursing. ◦ They also plan to stabilize Trust non-clinical banks and place greater emphasis on exit surveys to address staff turnover. 3. Primary Care and MDT Rollout: ◦ Acknowledging the pivotal role of primary care (which handles over 90% of all health contacts), the UUP will continue to empower primary care to deliver a broader range of services, including elective services. ◦ They commit to the further rollout of the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) programme. 4. Social Care and Fair Work: ◦ The party is committed to long-term sustainability and strengthening of the social care system. ◦ They will drive through the work of the Fair Work Forum to develop proposals aimed at improving terms and conditions and career prospects for social care staff. They emphasize that wages must climb well beyond the lowest levels for the sector to achieve sustainability. 5. Health Inequalities: ◦ The UUP has a renewed determination to drive improvements in population health and address health inequalities, with a new targeted and innovative health inequalities initiative slated for announcement in the autumn. The importance of the National Health Service (NHS), which delivers universal healthcare free at the point of use, is also highlighted as one of the most cherished benefits of Northern Ireland’s Union with Great Britain.",
          "housing": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto highlights the severity of the ongoing housing crisis and outlines a singular key policy commitment to address it.The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto highlights the severity of the ongoing housing crisis and outlines a singular key policy commitment to address it. Recognition of the Crisis The sources state that the United Kingdom is currently experiencing a pressing housing crisis, which has led to a significant number of citizens lacking a secure place to call home. This situation has caused an alarming surge in property prices and rental costs, pushing many into housing insecurity or even homelessness. The UUP recognizes that the housing crisis is a multi-faceted issue, impacting critical areas of life such as health, education, and the justice system. It is deemed imperative that all regions of the UK, including Northern Ireland, collaborate to develop and implement comprehensive housing strategies to tackle this crisis. Key Policy Commitment on Housing The UUP pledges: • To press the next Government to collaborate with the devolved administrations to develop and finance a robust strategy to tackle the housing crisis effectively. In essence, the party’s focus at Westminster is to ensure the UK Government works jointly with the devolved governments and provides the necessary funding for a strong, effective strategy to resolve the housing crisis.",
          "immigration": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto outlines its key policies on immigration, which focus on controlling illegal immigration while welcoming and supporting genuine asylum seekers and necessary skilled workers. Policy Commitments on Immigration The UUP’s core commitments regarding immigration are: • Zero-Tolerance Policy on Illegal Immigration: The party will implement a zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration while simultaneously being responsive to genuine asylum seekers. • Targeting People Traffickers: They will support government measures aimed at targeting people traffickers through cooperation with other European countries. The sources note that the market in people trafficking and illegal immigration has become \"big business\" which is cruel and exploitative and must be challenged and brought to a halt. • Expediting Asylum Applications: To ensure genuine asylum seekers are dealt with in a timely manner, the UUP will press to increase the number of staff working on asylum applications threefold. ◦ They commit to fast-tracking asylum applications for vulnerable individuals, specifically families with children, single mothers, or those who have protected professions such as doctors or pharmacists. • Integration and Support: For those who wish to make Northern Ireland their home and contribute, the UUP emphasizes the need to make them welcome and support their integration into society through education and health systems, absorbing values of tolerance, hard work, and civic responsibility. Context and Rationale The manifesto provides context for its stance on immigration: • Positive Contribution of Immigration: Controlled immigration is recognized as important to the UK, helping to create a skilled workforce. Northern Ireland specifically relies on people from other countries for doctors, nurses, other health care professionals, and for highly intensive manual jobs within the agri-food industry. • Impact of Illegal Immigration: The party notes that illegal immigration undermines established systems, places a burden on public services, and prevents genuine asylum seekers from being dealt with in a timely manner. • Multicultural Society: Northern Ireland is described as having moved away from \"the old binary labelling of Orange and Green\" and is now a multi-cultural society with a variety of ethnic minorities whose culture is celebrated and seen as enriching, welcoming, and positive. • Addressing Intimidation: A minority of people in Northern Ireland reportedly feel threatened by multi-cultural diversity, leading to intimidation. The UUP views this as unacceptable and will work across civic society and support the police to address and end race-related intimidation and discrimination. • Supporting Ethnic Minorities: They commit to supporting a Racial Equality Strategy for Northern Ireland, promoting a multicultural society, and ensuring fair and proportionate funding for ethnic minority and religious groups, including cultural events. The overall aim is to have an immigration system that is open, transparent, and fair.",
          "defence": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto outlines several key commitments regarding defence and security, emphasizing increased investment, bolstering the UK’s strategic capabilities, and enhancing Northern Ireland’s role in the UK’s defence infrastructure. Strategic Context and Increased Spending • The UUP views the world as less secure than it has been since the Cold War, citing multiple conflicts globally, including those in Ukraine, Syria, Southern Sudan, Mali, Yemen, and the Middle East. • They acknowledge the genuine threat Russia poses to the wider European region, noting that its invasion of Ukraine has drawn battle lines between NATO and the Russian Federation and its allies (China, North Korea, and Belarus). • The party commits to voting to increase UK Defence Spending beyond the NATO Target of 2% of national GDP to 2.5%. • They recognize that the UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a major contributor to NATO, and holds multi-lateral and bi-lateral defence agreements globally. Collective Defence is identified as the UK’s greatest asset, allowing it to defend freedom and democracy where threatened. Northern Ireland’s Role in Defence The UUP insists that the UK must take Northern Ireland’s strategic position seriously in defence planning, especially given the current \"pre-war world\" as described by the Secretary of State for Defence. • Integration into Command Structures: It is important that Northern Ireland is brought into the UK’s \"National Defence Command\" structures. • Naval Base: The party will support the establishment of a Naval Base in Northern Ireland. This would allow NATO assets to be deployed from Northern Ireland to increase patrolling of the UK’s western approaches. • RAF Presence: They support Aldergrove Military Base reverting back to an RAF station. This would enable the forward mounting of airframes, alleviating the burden on Scottish bases and allowing them to focus on the UK’s Northern approaches. An enhanced RAF presence is also needed to enable the quick interception of hostile aircraft. • Defence Industry: The UUP will lobby to increase Northern Ireland’s share of the defence industry manufacturing base, which includes research and development. Northern Ireland already plays a part in defence output through the manufacturing of NLAW missiles (anti-armour weapons used by Ukrainian armed forces) and surface-to-air missiles like HVM. • Armed Forces Personnel: They commit to maintaining the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland, both Regular and Reserve, not below 3,000 personnel. • Nuclear Deterrent: The party will continue to support the UK’s independent nuclear deterrent. Addressing Irish Defence and UK Security The manifesto highlights concerns regarding the UK’s western defences and the Republic of Ireland’s lack of defence maturity: • Western Approaches: Limited ability to react to Russian intelligence shipping and warships operating in the \"Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap\" undermines UK and Europe’s defences. • Ireland’s Preparedness: The UUP notes that the Irish Government’s ability to protect its underseas cabling is \"non-existent,\" and its general preparedness is \"abysmal\" and \"unsustainable,\" relying on others. • Encouraging Irish Cooperation: They will encourage the Republic of Ireland to take defence seriously and either enhance their Partnership and Cooperation Programme or join NATO and commit to spending 2% of GDP on defence. • Airheads: Enhanced Naval and RAF platforms in Northern Ireland could assist with the protection of rapid deployments of military assets from the US and Canada via Shannon or Aldergrove airports, creating two important airheads that allow for redundancy if Ireland were to regress further from providing support to deploying US assets. The UUP is grateful for the protection provided by the UK’s Armed Forces, who guarantee Northern Ireland’s defence and security, and notes that the people of Northern Ireland are over-represented in the Armed Forces by share of population.",
          "economy": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto, \"Making Northern Ireland Work,\" emphasizes economic growth, utilizing the benefits of the Union, and implementing targeted tax and investment policies. The goal of growing the economy is central to the manifesto’s underlying framework of the \"5Ps\" (people, place, prosperity, public services, and peace). Key economic policies outlined in the manifesto include: Investment and Regional Growth • City Deals and Growth Deals: The UUP affirms its commitment to supporting City Deals and Growth Deals across Northern Ireland, including the Belfast Region City Deal and others in Derry-Londonderry/Strabane, Mid South West, and Causeway Coast and Glens. These initiatives, supported by potential investment of £1.3 billion funded by Westminster and Stormont, are intended to foster global centres of innovation excellence by harnessing the expertise of universities and businesses. • Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): The party aims to see the economy grow through Foreign Direct Investment and by utilizing and promoting Small, Medium, and Micro enterprises. • Key Sectors: The party recognizes agriculture as Northern Ireland’s largest industry (feeding around 10 million people across the UK and EU). They also note the importance of healthy fintech, cybersecurity, aerospace, and defence sectors. Taxation and Business Competitiveness • Corporation Tax Reduction: Ulster Unionists aim to work with Westminster to gradually reduce Corporation Tax in Northern Ireland to 15%. This reduction, coupled with implementing necessary reforms, is intended to enhance competitiveness, attract investment, and drive economic growth. • Hospitality VAT Reduction: Recognizing that Northern Ireland’s tourism and hospitality sector faces unfair competition from the Republic of Ireland (RoI), the party will work at Westminster to seek commitment to lower Leisure and Hospitality VAT in Northern Ireland to match the rate in the Republic of Ireland. This is designed to allow local businesses (hotels, restaurants, and leisure) to compete on a level playing field. Trade and Regulatory Advantage • Freeport Northern Ireland: The UUP will lobby in Parliament to establish a \"Freeport Northern Ireland,\" capitalizing on UK government policy. Given Northern Ireland’s unique geographical circumstances, they advocate for designating all ports and airports (including Londonderry, Aldergrove, Warrenpoint, Belfast, and Larne) as freeports to extend benefits across the entire region. • Trusted Trader Scheme: They will also argue for the creation of a \"Trusted Trader\" scheme to enable businesses outside secure port zones to access processing relief at zero tariff rates, maximizing economic benefits. Workforce and Energy • Job Skills Fund: The party pledges to invest in skills development through the establishment of a Northern Ireland Job Skills Fund, similar to successful programmes in Scotland and the RoI. This fund would involve government, business, and trade unions collaborating with educational institutions to provide targeted skills training. • Skills Investment: The UUP commits to dedicating funding equivalent to the UK Apprenticeship Levy paid by Northern Ireland firms, ensuring a minimum annual investment of no less than £35 million into the Skills Fund. • Energy Market Integration: The party renews its pledge to review energy security and prices, advocating for the creation of an All-Islands (UK & Ireland) energy market. This is intended to leverage the benefits of greater integration with Great Britain’s energy markets, enhancing energy security, reducing prices, and streamlining regulatory oversight. Pensions and General Taxation • Pensions Triple Lock: Ulster Unionist MPs firmly believe in maintaining the UK’s \"triple lock\" for state pensions, ensuring the financial security and dignity of the elderly population. • Progressive Taxation: They advocate for a progressive approach to taxation, ensuring the burden is distributed equitably.",
          "education": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto outlines its key policies on education, driven by the belief that the future of Northern Ireland depends on the potential of its children and young people. The overall commitment is to build a world-class education system that is inclusive, supportive, and high-quality for all children, regardless of ability, disability, or support needs. The party’s commitments in education are summarized across four main areas: 1. Establishing a Single Education System The UUP plans to establish a single education system that aims to : • Value every child equally, ensuring tailored support and resources are provided to meet individual needs. • Integrate children of all abilities, thereby fostering a culture of mutual respect and inclusivity. • Promote early support and intervention, recognizing the critical role of early education and childcare in a child’s holistic development and the well-being of families. 2. Early Education and Childcare To ensure every child receives the best start in life, the UUP will focus on : • Advocating for high-quality early education and childcare services that are accessible and affordable for all families. • Supporting initiatives that enhance the early learning experience, which lays a strong foundation for future academic and personal success. • Enabling families to thrive by providing flexible childcare solutions that support parents and caregivers. 3. Therapeutic Learning Environments and Resources The party recognizes that a well-resourced educational environment is vital for fostering learning and development. They commit to: • Securing adequate funding to create and maintain therapeutic learning environments that cater to the diverse needs of all students. • Ensuring that schools are equipped with the necessary resources, including modern facilities and learning materials, to support every child’s educational journey. 4. Support for Educators and Students with Disabilities The success of the system relies on dedicated staff and support for all students, especially those with disabilities. • Valuing Educators: They will advocate for fair and competitive pay for teachers, classroom assistants, childcare staff, and the entire multidisciplinary team involved in education. They aim to recognize and reward the invaluable contributions of all education professionals, ensuring they are supported and appreciated. • Supporting Young People with Disabilities: They are committed to creating equal opportunities for young people with disabilities. This includes securing funding and resources for post-secondary education and training for these young people. • The party will work to develop pathways to further learning and employment opportunities that are on par with those available to mainstream school leavers. The overarching goal is to ensure all young people in Northern Ireland have access to the support and opportunities they need to succeed, regardless of their abilities.",

Climate Change and Emissions Targets • The UUP has a strong commitment to addressing the climate emergency in Northern Ireland. • While disappointed that their proposal for Northern Ireland’s \"fair contribution\" to the UK Net Zero greenhouse gas target was not fully incorporated into the final Bill, the UUP remains dedicated to achieving substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. • They embrace the recommendation of the independent Climate Change Committee for an 82% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. • The party will continue to strive for an 82% or better reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 as part of a comprehensive climate mitigation strategy, rather than the 100% target currently legislated. • The UUP is committed to ensuring that Northern Ireland makes a fair contribution to the goal of UK Net Zero. • They support the UK’s Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, which seeks to mobilise public and private investment in clean technologies such as wind, carbon capture, and hydrogen. They believe investing in these technologies will enable Northern Ireland to contribute to a New Green Industrial Revolution and lead the world in combating climate change. • They emphasize that leveraging Northern Ireland’s position within the UK is necessary to access the resources, expertise, and collaborative opportunities required to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Lough Neagh Crisis • The UUP understands the urgent need for a collaborative effort to address the pressing issues affecting Lough Neagh’s water quality and long-term sustainability. • They stress the necessity of establishing a management task force inclusive of all stakeholders to oversee ongoing monitoring, management, and the formulation of future plans for the Lough. • Collaboration among Stormont Executive departments, arms-length bodies, and stakeholders is vital to charting a viable path forward. • The party will continue to press NI Water for an urgent assessment of the proximity to a critical tipping point where Lough Neagh water may become unusable for drinking. • The UUP is resolute in its commitment to preserving the ecological integrity of Lough Neagh through collaborative, cross-departmental efforts to mitigate pollution, protect wildlife, and ensure the availability of clean drinking water. Woodland and Rural Environment • Ulster Unionists commit to planting more of the right trees in the right places and doing more to look after existing trees and woods, as trees capture carbon and woodlands provide habitats for wildlife. • This will help Northern Ireland make a fair contribution to the UK’s efforts to tackle climate change, assist nature recovery, reduce the risk of flooding, create new green jobs, and improve access to woods for everyone. • They will also safeguard the natural environment and biodiversity of the countryside, working closely with farmers as the stewards of the land. Agriculture and Sustainability In relation to agriculture, the manifesto commits to supporting sustainability across the sector: • They will increase funding for research, development, and knowledge transfer to drive innovation, productivity, and sustainability across the agri-food sector. • They will work in partnership with farmers to develop a comprehensive, long-term strategy for the future of Northern Ireland agriculture. Overall, the UUP’s environmental policies seek a balanced approach, integrating climate action with economic and rural considerations, and relying heavily on collaboration and leveraging Northern Ireland’s place within the UK to secure necessary resources and expertise.",
          "brexit": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s policies concerning Brexit primarily center on their commitment to safeguarding Northern Ireland’s position within the United Kingdom while addressing the complexities and ongoing challenges created by the Northern Ireland Protocol and its successor, the Windsor Framework. The key policies are summarized under the following headings: The Union and Challenging Divergence • Safeguarding the Union: The UUP stands firm in its commitment to safeguarding Northern Ireland’s integral position within the United Kingdom. They will continue to fight for the preservation of the Union. • Challenging Erosion of Sovereignty: The party will work with a new government at Westminster to challenge any attempts to erode Northern Ireland’s sovereignty or undermine the integrity of the Union. • Challenging Divergence: They will challenge the outworkings of the Windsor Framework that cause further divergence between Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland. • Economic Benefits: The UUP highlights that the Union allows Northern Ireland to trade with the rest of the UK and provides access to global markets through the UK’s extensive network of trade agreements. Stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol and Windsor Framework • Opposition to the Protocol: The UUP has consistently campaigned against the Northern Ireland Protocol since it was imposed on the region. • Windsor Framework as a Stepping-Stone: The party views the Windsor Framework as a stepping-stone in addressing the challenges posed by the Protocol. • Vigilant Scrutiny: While acknowledging progress, the UUP remains vigilant in scrutinising the outworking of the Framework, as well as future negotiations between Westminster and the EU. • Restoring the Internal Market: The ultimate goal of this scrutiny is to ensure that Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market is fully restored. • Need for Further Reform: The party recognizes the complexities and nuances of the Framework and acknowledges that further reforms will be necessary to address constantly developing concerns. Democratic Scrutiny Mechanisms • Reviewing Scrutiny Processes: The UUP will campaign to have the existing scrutiny processes of the Windsor Framework reviewed and replaced with structures that guarantee necessary safeguards. • Committee Concerns: They have already highlighted concerns that the Windsor Framework Democratic Scrutiny Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly is \"not fit for purpose,\" as its ability to effectively assess EU legislation and policies impacting Northern Ireland is greatly reduced by its inability to act collegiately. Trade and Economic Measures • \"Freeport Northern Ireland\": Capitalizing on UK government policy, the UUP will lobby for the establishment of a \"Freeport Northern Ireland,\" specifically addressing Northern Ireland’s \"unique geographical circumstances and the impact of the Northern Ireland Protocol\". They advocate for designating all ports and airports (including Londonderry, Aldergrove, Warrenpoint, Belfast, and Larne) as freeports. • \"Trusted Trader\" Scheme: They will argue for the creation of a \"Trusted Trader\" scheme to allow businesses outside secure port zones to access processing relief at zero tariff rates, thereby maximizing economic benefits.",
          "entire manifesto": "The Ulster Unionist Party’s 2024 Westminster Manifesto, titled \"Making Northern Ireland Work,\" is underpinned by \"The 5Ps\": people, place, prosperity, public services, and peace, with a focus on growing the economy.

        {
          "crime": "The TUV Manifesto outlines several key policies related to policing, justice, legacy issues, and the treatment of criminals, particularly focusing on Northern Ireland’s specific constitutional challenges and alignment with the Reform UK platform on immigration. 1. Policing and Justice in Northern Ireland The TUV notes a huge crisis of confidence in the PSNI within the Unionist community. Their policies in this area demand significant changes: • End Two-Tier Policing: They insist that blatant two-tier policing must end. • Merit-Based Recruitment: They demand an end to the \"anti-Protestant discrimination of 50/50\" and affirm that recruitment must be based on merit. • Investigating Historic Crimes: TUV finds the equivocation of the DOJ and PSNI over who investigates the non-terrorist criminality of the IRA to be intolerable. This fuels their belief that a \"blind eye approach\" exists regarding the extra-curriculum activities of Provisionals under the \"peace process,\" a matter TUV will continue to pursue. • Policing Board Exclusion: TUV supports banning convicted criminals (citing Gerry Kelly as an example) from holding positions on the Policing Board. Jim Allister drafted a Private Members Bill to achieve this, though it was defeated by the combined efforts of Sinn Fein, the SDLP, and Alliance. 2. Legacy and Victims Issues TUV seeks a radical change to the whole approach to legacy and victims : • Changing the Definition of Victim: The definition of \"victim\" needs to change to exclude victim makers so that \"the innocent must reclaim the word ’victim’\". • No Amnesty and Legacy Act Opposition: TUV maintains there can be no amnesty for historic crimes, as many victims continue to demand justice. Consequently, TUV is opposed to the Legacy Act which has \"shut the door on justice\". • Rejecting \"Truth Commissions\": Any form of \"truth commission\" should be rejected because terrorists have already proved they have no interest in the truth. • Serious Criminal Investigations: The PSNI should get serious about criminal investigations of historic crimes where evidence exists, ensuring political considerations play no part. • Glorification of Terrorism: Legislation on the glorification of terrorism needs to be revisited and applied equally across the UK regardless of the terror group being celebrated. • Role of the Republic of Ireland: The Republic of Ireland should be made to face up to its historic role in facilitating terrorism in Northern Ireland by providing a safe haven for terrorists. 3. Immigration and Foreign Criminals TUV supports the robust migration policies aligned with Reform UK across the whole of the UK. Key measures related to foreign criminality and illegal migration include: • Deportation of Foreign Criminals: TUV supports the policy to deport foreign nationals immediately after their prison sentence ends. • Citizenship Withdrawal: They advocate for withdrawing citizenship from immigrants who commit crime, with the exception of some misdemeanor offenses. • Illegal Migration/The Protocol: The manifesto highlights that the UK Government’s Rwanda Bill cannot apply in Northern Ireland due to the supremacy of EU law imposed by the Protocol, making Northern Ireland a potential \"magnet for illegal migrants\". • Stopping Illegal Migrants: The plan to \"Stop the Boats\" includes securing the immediate detention for all illegal migrants and ensuring zero illegal immigrants are resettled in the UK.",
          "healthcare": "The TUV Manifesto outlines several key policies regarding health and the NHS, emphasizing constitutional issues that affect the health service, alongside demands for increased funding, better staffing, and a defense of the sanctity of life. Constitutional Threat to the NHS The TUV views the constitutional subjugation of Northern Ireland to EU law via the Protocol as a direct threat to the functioning of the NHS in the region. • Foreign Law Supremacy: The Northern Ireland Protocol/Windsor Framework means that the UK is \"ruled in significant part by its foreign laws and court\". • Specific Example (Dental Care): TUV highlights that Northern Ireland has no say in over 300 areas of law decided by the EU. For example, the EU is currently proposing to ban the use of amalgam in dental fillings from January 1, 2025. The TUV notes that if this ban proceeds in Northern Ireland, the NHS Dental services are likely to become unsustainable here, even as they continue in Great Britain, because current NHS funding barely covers the cost of amalgam procedures, and alternatives are much more expensive. TUV considers it \"absurd\" and \"completely intolerable\" that a foreign Parliament should consider imposing legislation that places an aspect of the NHS in jeopardy. Investment and Service Provision TUV criticizes the current administration for failing to prioritize the health service, noting that the budget passed by Stormont was down by 2.3% compared to what was actually spent by the end of last year. • Sustained Investment: Sustaining long term investment in health is a TUV priority. • Prioritizing Frontline Resources: TUV argues that money should be put into providing more nurses, doctors and beds in hospitals, rather than squandering millions on schemes like the Irish language, north/south structures, or \"rights agendas\". They stress that the NHS needs more doctors and nurses, not more deputy directors. • Opposing Closures: They are opposed to the closure of minor injuries units and other local facilities, noting that closures should not be the default position to save money. • Restoring GP Services: A readily accessible GP service must be restored, which TUV notes will help ease the burden on Emergency Departments (A&Es). Getting an appointment with a GP should not be a challenge. Staffing and Workforce TUV recognizes that appalling waiting lists are due, in large measure, to Stormont’s failure to prioritize health, leading to the removal of hundreds of beds and associated staff. • Disincentivize Agency Reliance: The drift to agencies must be disincentivised and loyalty to the NHS rewarded to address the \"haemorrhaging of skilled nurses and realignment to agencies\". • Nursing Reserve Service: TUV continues to campaign for the creation of a Nursing Reserve Service, akin to the Army Reserve. This service would enlist retired and former nurses, requiring them to keep up with relevant training, receive modest remuneration as reserves, and be available to be called upon in an emergency. Mental Health and Specific Care Needs • Mental Health Funding: TUV recognizes the importance of facing up to the mental health problem and supports increased funding for Community Mental Health services. This funding would support people experiencing mental ill-health in their recovery and promote early intervention strategies to help prevent the need for hospital admissions. • Acute Beds: They believe there is a need for adequate acute psychiatric beds so that any patient requiring one can access it within their Trust area. They argue that no patient should be forced to travel outside their Trust area, as proximity to family and friends is vital for mental wellbeing. • Cancer Services: TUV stresses that strenuous efforts are now required to make up the lost ground in meeting general needs, particularly in respect of cancer. Pro-Life Stance TUV affirms its position on social issues concerning the sanctity of life: • Opposition to Abortion: TUV is unashamedly pro-life. They oppose the full commissioning of abortion services (demanded by Sinn Fein and Alliance MLAs). Halting the \"pandemic of destruction of the unborn\" is a key TUV goal. • Opposition to Euthanasia: They believe in the sanctity of life and oppose euthanasia at the end-of-life stage.",
          "housing": "The TUV Manifesto addresses housing policy with a focus on ensuring suitable, decent accommodation for all citizens, alongside specific proposals for maintenance, development, and social policy concerning housing allocation. Here is a summary of the key policies on housing: 1. Ensuring Decent Housing and Maintenance The TUV believes that everyone is entitled to decent housing. A key priority is addressing the common request of Housing Executive and Housing Association tenants: repairs to be carried out in a timely manner. • Proactive Funding for Basics: TUV argues that adequate funding can be found for basics like proactive maintenance and addressing issues like mould, especially given that others propose expenditure on items that deliver \"no tangible day to day benefit\" (such as Casement Park). 2. Housing Supply and Development • Dereliction: The manifesto states that the dereliction of housing in working class areas cannot continue. • Urban Renewal: TUV proposes a policy of one house down and at least one house up in urban areas. • Boosting Housebuilding (Economic Policy): In alignment with the Reform UK platform, TUV supports policies designed to substantially boost housebuilding. This includes cutting Residential Stamp Duty to 0% below £750k (2% from £750k - £1.5m and 4% over £1.5m). • Planning Reform: They also support reforming the planning system to fast-track new housing on brownfield sites. • Relieving Pressure (Immigration): TUV notes that strict limits on immigration are necessary to relieve pressure on the housing supply. 3. Housing Policy Reform and Social Issues • Housing Points System: TUV believes there is an urgent need for reform of the housing points system. For example, they highlight that the current arrangement, which only awards homeless points 28 days prior to the termination of a tenancy agreement, does not give people adequate time to secure alternative accommodation. • Opposing Social Engineering: TUV states that social engineering should play no part in housing policy. • Supporting Local Communities: They acknowledge that the \"change wrought by an open border policy with the EU\" has left a legacy of issues, and where assimilation has not occurred, it is often the indigenous community that feels uncomfortable. TUV commits to ensuring that local communities are supported and their rights and interests respected. The TUV manifesto connects pressure on housing directly to immigration levels and the constitutional issue of the Protocol, which prevents UK-wide measures like the Rwanda Bill from applying to Northern Ireland, potentially making it a \"magnet for illegal migrants\".",
          "immigration": "The TUV Manifesto’s key policies on immigration are explicitly linked to the party’s core constitutional concern regarding the Northern Ireland Protocol and are largely adopted through their common platform with Reform UK. Here is a summary of the key policies on immigration: 1. Constitutional Issues and Northern Ireland The TUV emphasizes that the Northern Ireland Protocol prevents UK-wide immigration policies from fully applying in the region, creating a significant constitutional and practical problem. • Rwanda Bill Exclusion: A High Court judgment ruled that the UK Government’s Rwanda Bill cannot apply in Northern Ireland. • Supremacy of EU Law: This ruling occurred because of the supremacy of EU law bestowed by Article 2 of the Protocol, which subjects Northern Ireland alone in the United Kingdom to its laws and rights. • Magnet for Illegal Migrants: The TUV warns that the consequence of this constitutional distinction is that Northern Ireland will now become a magnet for illegal migrants, who will flood in to escape the potential consequences of the Rwanda scheme applied elsewhere in the UK. • Protocol Link: TUV states that for as long as the Sea Border remains, Northern Ireland will not be covered by potential tougher measures to curb immigration, even if the next government is forced to introduce them. • Vote for Robust Policy: A vote for TUV is presented as a vote for a robust migration policy across the whole of the UK. 2. Core Immigration Policies (Shared with Reform UK) The TUV agrees with the position of Reform UK, stating that \"Uncontrolled mass immigration has pushed the UK to breaking point\" and must be curtailed to protect wages, public services, and British culture and values. The policies include: • Freeze Non-Essential Immigration: Strict limits on immigration are necessary to relieve pressure on housing, public services, and to increase wages and protect culture, identity, and values. ◦ The only exception for migration must be essential skills, mainly around healthcare. • Stopping Illegal Immigration (\"Stop the Boats\"): TUV supports a four-point plan to stop illegal migrants : 1. Leave the European Convention on Human Rights. 2. Establish a new Department of Immigration with the policy of zero illegal immigrants to be resettled in the UK. 3. Pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France. 4. Implement secure detention for all illegal migrants. • Asylum Seekers: ◦ Secure Detention for all Asylum Seekers who arrive illegally from safe countries. ◦ Processing should be rapid, offshore if necessary. ◦ Those entering from a safe country will be barred from claiming asylum or citizenship. ◦ There will be no legal aid for non-citizens, and those rejected will be returned. 3. Measures on Foreign Workers and Criminals • Employer Immigration Tax: The National Insurance (NI) rate will be raised to 20% for foreign workers. ◦ The goal is to incentivize businesses to employ British citizens, whose NI rate would stay at 13.8%. ◦ Essential foreign health and care workers, and businesses employing five staff members or fewer, would be exempt from this tax. ◦ This measure is projected to raise more than £20 billion over five years to fund apprenticeships and training for young British people. • Immediate Deportation for Foreign Criminals: Foreign nationals should be deported immediately after their prison sentence ends. • Withdrawing Citizenship: TUV advocates for withdrawing citizenship from immigrants who commit crime, with the exception of some misdemeanor offenses. • Student Dependents and Health Tourism: ◦ New visa rules for international students will bar dependents. ◦ Only international students with essential skills can remain in the UK, and TUV seeks to close down fake courses and immigration schemes that abuse the rules. ◦ They aim to stop Health Tourism. ◦ TUV will impose a requirement of 5 years residency and employment to claim any benefits in the UK. The TUV’s immigration platform is positioned as a remedy for the \"uncontrolled mass immigration\" nationally, while simultaneously demanding the removal of the constitutional \"Sea Border\" to ensure NI can be fully included in these robust UK-wide controls.",
          "defence": "The TUV Manifesto addresses defense policy, primarily focusing on the treatment of the armed forces, their equipment, and the application of the Military Covenant across the United Kingdom, while also linking defense and foreign affairs to the broader constitutional issue of the Protocol. Here is a summary of the key policies on defense: , while also linking defense and foreign affairs to the broader constitutional issue of the Protocol. Here is a summary of the key policies on defense: 1. Support for Armed Forces and Veterans The TUV expresses strong support for the UK Armed Forces, while criticizing political decisions affecting their operational readiness and welfare. • Recognition and Valor: The sources state that the UK has some of the best and bravest Armed Forces in the world. • Criticism of Equipment and Cuts: TUV criticizes politicians for sending service members abroad with poor equipment. They also highlight that the Army has been cut to its smallest size in 300 years. • Military Covenant Reform: TUV believes the Military Covenant should be reformed so that those who put their lives on the line receive the support they deserve both during and after service. • Substandard Housing: Military housing is described as substandard. • Abandonment of Veterans: TUV notes that the wounded and veterans are often abandoned. • Unjust Legal Claims: TUV highlights that some veterans and service members still face unjust legal claims. 2. Legal and Constitutional Application TUV advocates for ensuring that the support mechanisms for the military are legally binding and applicable in Northern Ireland: • Amending the Northern Ireland Act: TUV believes that the 1998 Northern Ireland Act should be amended to give full effect to the Military Covenant in all parts of the UK. 3. Defence and Foreign Affairs in Context of the Protocol TUV connects the broader constitutional issues of the Protocol to the UK’s ability to maximize its global potential in foreign affairs and defense: • Global Opportunities: TUV believes that the whole of the UK should be able to benefit from Brexit and the global opportunities it presents. • Sea Border Constraint: They state that the Sea Border prevents Northern Ireland from taking advantage of these global opportunities when it comes to foreign affairs and defense. • Sending a Message: Voting TUV is presented as a way to send a message that the Sea Border constraint on foreign affairs and defense is unacceptable.",
          "economy": "The TUV Manifesto’s key policies on the economy are divided into two main areas—personal finances (Cost of Living) and business taxation/regulation—and are fundamentallyThe TUV Manifesto’s key policies on the economy are divided into two main areas—personal finances (Cost of Living) and business taxation/regulation—and are fundamentally framed by the constitutional effects of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The economic policies detailed are explicitly based on the common platform agreed upon with Reform UK. 1. Constitutional and Economic Constraints (The Protocol) The TUV views the constitutional subjugation of Northern Ireland (NI) as the core obstacle preventing the region from benefiting economically. • Splintered Union and Loss of Market: The Protocol has \"splintered our union with GB\" and cut NI off from the UK Single Market for goods, which was previously a fully integrated economy of nearly 70 million people. • Increased Costs and Supply Disruption: The Protocol imposes a customs and SPS (Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary) border across the Irish Sea, necessitating a \"huge increase in the amount of customs and SPS paperwork\". This disrupts the supply chain from Great Britain and drives up prices for the consumer, thus adding to the cost of living crisis in Northern Ireland. • EU Law and VAT: Because of the Protocol, Northern Ireland is tied to EU rules which insist on at least 5% VAT on energy bills. • Economic Alignment: The Protocol promotes the restructuring of supply chains and encourages the alignment of Northern Ireland with the Republic. TUV states that the Protocol is a \"dynamo for Irish unity\" through \"dynamic economic alignment\" in key areas like agri-food, goods, and trade. • The Solution: TUV demands the removal of the Sea Border to ensure the \"completion of a full Brexit so that the United Kingdom in all its parts enjoys full independence and economic freedom\". 2. Personal Economy and Cost of Living TUV shares the Reform UK approach to the personal economy, aimed at making work pay and easing the cost of living crisis. • Income Tax Reform (Make Work Pay): ◦ Lift the Income Tax Start Point to £20,000 Per Year. This policy is designed to free up to 7 million people from paying Income Tax and save every worker almost £1,500 per year. ◦ The basic tax rate is to remain at 20%. ◦ The higher tax rate should begin at £70,000. • Energy Cost Reduction: TUV policies aim to save households over £500 per year. This would be achieved by: ◦ Scrapping VAT on energy bills. ◦ Scrapping environmental levies. ◦ Lowering fuel duty by 20p per litre for both residential and business users. • Housing Market Stimulation: TUV proposes cutting Residential Stamp Duty to 0% below £750k. This is intended to substantially boost economic activity and housebuilding. • Tourism: Abolish the VAT Tourist Tax, referring to the stopped VAT refund scheme for tourist shopping, which they claim has cost the economy over £10 billion and deterred up to 2 million tourists. 3. Business Economy and Taxation TUV supports policies aimed at backing risk-takers and wealth creators, making Britain \"open for business\". • Corporation Tax Cuts: ◦ Raise the minimum profit threshold to £100k to free over 1.2 million small and medium-sized businesses from Corporation Tax. ◦ Reduce the main Corporation Tax Rate from 25% to 20%, and further reduce it to 15% from Year 3. • Support for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs): ◦ Abolish Business Rates for high street based SMEs. ◦ Offset this by introducing an Online Delivery Tax at 4% for large, multinational enterprises, aiming to create a fairer playing field for high streets. ◦ Cut entrepreneurs’ tax to 5%. • Support for Self-Employed: ◦ Abolish IR35 Rules to support sole traders. ◦ Raise the VAT Threshold to £150,000 to free up small entrepreneurs from red tape. • Reform and Red Tape: ◦ Slash Red Tape to boost industry and exports by scrapping thousands of laws that hold back British business and damage productivity. ◦ Major simplification of the tax system is needed, as the UK’s tax code is over 21,000 pages. ◦ Reform the Planning System to fast-track new housing on brownfield sites and infrastructure projects to boost businesses. 4. Fair Funding and Financial Prudence TUV stresses the need for prudent government spending and a fair funding deal for Northern Ireland. • Opposing Squander: TUV promotes smaller government to keep taxation down and opposes politically motivated schemes that cost the taxpayer, citing Casement Park as a prime example of squander. • Fair Funding Deal: TUV will fight for a fair financial funding deal for Northern Ireland in Westminster, ensuring the funding formula is updated to account for local needs. • Senior Citizens: TUV will work to maintain the triple lock on state pensions. The economic vision is one of low taxation, reduced regulation, and maximized financial integration with the rest of Great Britain, which TUV argues is fundamentally obstructed by the Protocol.",
          "education": "The TUV Manifesto details several key policies regarding education, focusing primarily on addressing educational underachievement, supporting academic selection, curriculum reform, and improving conditions for teachers and classroomThe TUV Manifesto details several key policies regarding education, focusing primarily on addressing educational underachievement, supporting academic selection, curriculum reform, and improving conditions for teachers and classroom assistants. Here is a summary of the key policies on education: Core Priorities and Equality • Tackling Underachievement: The TUV sees tackling educational underachievement as its number one priority, specifically highlighting the need to address this for the Protestant working class. • Addressing Inequality: The manifesto aims to address the shortage of funding and the imbalance between sectors, noting that this disparity is \"hitting the controlled sector particularly hard\". Specific Policy Proposals TUV proposes the following measures to achieve better educational outcomes : 1. Academic Selection: A commitment to academic selection is maintained. 2. School System: They aim to create a more equal system encompassing both exceptional Grammar and non-selective schools. 3. Curriculum Overhaul: TUV advocates for an evidence-informed curriculum overhaul. 4. Staffing and Pay: The party supports investment in teacher recruitment and fair teacher pay. 5. Pathways to Success: They propose the creation of a system in which children can find different paths to successful outcomes. 6. Vocational Training: Support is given to vocational training for those seeking apprenticeships, commencing at school and continuing into Further Education (FE) with employer support. 7. Culture of Achievement: TUV seeks the creation of a culture of \"celebration\" for hard work and achievement across all aspects of school life. 8. Job Market Connection: They emphasize helping children see value in education by ensuring it connects them to a job market that harnesses their skills and talents. 9. Community Connection: The manifesto supports schools connecting with their communities, parents, and external agencies. 10. Teaching Profession: They propose developing a culture of trust in and respect for the teaching profession, noting that this trust has been eroded. Support for Classroom Assistants TUV states its belief in a fair deal for classroom assistants, including greater job security and holiday pay. Social Issues in Schools In relation to social issues affecting education, TUV emphasizes its stance on traditional family values and gender identity: • Opposing Progressive Agenda: TUV states it will actively oppose the \"progressive\" agenda regarding gender identity in schools. • Gender Determination: They assert that gender is determined at birth.",
          "environment": "The TUV Manifesto addresses environmental policies primarily through the lens of protecting the agricultural economy and opposing measures related to climate change mandates. Here is a summary of the key policies on the environment: 1. Opposition to Anti-Farming Ideology and Net Zero The TUV views the pursuit of certain environmental goals as a direct threat to Northern Ireland’s vital agricultural sector: • The future of Northern Ireland’s £5 billion farming and food sector must not be jeopardized by the pursuit of an anti-farming ideology associated with climate change activists. • TUV considers the pursuit of net zero Climate Change demands to be \"utter folly\" because it will reduce food production capacity in Northern Ireland. • TUV was clear and determined in opposing the Green Party’s Private Member’s Bill (which was supported by Sinn Fein, SDLP, Alliance, and the UUP) and commits to continue to protect farming interests. 2. Reducing Environmental Levies As part of their policy to cut energy taxes and alleviate the cost of living crisis, TUV proposes removing certain financial burdens linked to environmental policy: • TUV seeks to Scrap environmental levies on energy bills. This action is intended to save households over £500 per year.",
          "brexit": "The sources, which are excerpts from the TUV Manifesto 2024, focus heavily on the impact of the Brexit arrangements on Northern Ireland, particularly the Northern Ireland Protocol (or Windsor Framework), and outline the TUV and Reform UK joint policies aimed at addressing these consequences. Core Stance and Constitutional Goals The primary goal of the TUV is to restore the Union and achieve the reunification of the UK, which they assert has been \"splintered by the Protocol\". The TUV—who are campaigning with Reform UK under a Memorandum of Understanding—are committed to a common platform on Brexit : • Upholding and strengthening the Union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, including the full restoration of Article 6 of the Act(s) of Union. • The rejection of the Irish Sea border and the subjection of Northern Ireland to EU law and the ECJ. • The completion of a full Brexit so that the United Kingdom in all its parts enjoys full independence and economic freedom. The TUV manifesto urges a vote of \"No Sea Border\". Criticisms of the Protocol and Windsor Framework The TUV regards the current arrangements as a profound constitutional crisis and affront to national politics : 1. Loss of Sovereignty and Rule by EU Law: Westminster is no longer sovereign over Northern Ireland. NI is partitioned by a border in the Irish Sea, and unaccountable rule from Brussels dictates many aspects of life. Northern Ireland is now a \"condominium,\" ruled partly by UK laws and partly by foreign EU laws. 2. Disenfranchisement: Northern Ireland is subject to foreign EU laws in over 300 areas of law where its citizens have no say. This is described as the \"Great Vote Robbery\"—the disenfranchisement of 1.9 million people. 3. Economic Disruption: The Protocol denied Northern Ireland the Brexit enjoyed by Great Britain. It is prioritizing the protection of the integrity of the EU’s Single Market, which caused the imposition of the Irish Sea Border as a Customs and SPS (Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary) border. This border has cut NI off from the UK Single Market for goods, replacing the previously integrated UK economy with two separate economies, which promotes alignment with the Republic of Ireland. 4. Failed Solutions: ◦ The Windsor Framework is criticized for perpetuating the Irish Sea border. It is described as \"worse than the original Northern Ireland Protocol\" and means NI is still in the EU’s single market for goods. Even the less demanding Green Lane still involves the imposition of a customs and international SPA border because Northern Ireland is subject to the EU’s Customs Code. ◦ The DUP’s \"Safeguarding the Union\" or Donaldson-Robinson Deal is claimed to have been a \"sleight of hand,\" as the proposed UK Internal Market System was just \"another name for the Green Lane,\" resulting in no actual changes. 5. Driver for Irish Unity: The Protocol is viewed as a \"dynamo for Irish unity\" because the 300 areas of law now under EU/Republic of Ireland control lead to dynamic economic alignment with the Republic, establishing an all-Ireland through economic fusion. 6. Specific Policy Impacts: ◦ Cost of Living: The Protocol contributes to the cost of living crisis by adding paperwork, disrupting supply chains from GB, driving up prices , and requiring NI to adhere to EU rules insisting on at least 5% VAT on energy bills. ◦ Immigration: EU law supremacy, bestowed by Article 2 of the Protocol, overruled the UK Government’s Rwanda Bill’s applicability in Northern Ireland, making NI a potential \"magnet for illegal migrants\". ◦ Agriculture: NI farmers are betrayed by being subject to EU law concerning veterinary medicines, which causes a \"mammoth problem\" for the agri-food industry as 85% of medicines traditionally come from GB. Proposed Solutions and Action TUV and Reform UK propose the following actions to resolve the Brexit issues affecting Northern Ireland: 1. Abandon the Windsor Framework: Reform UK’s manifesto commitment, which TUV welcomes and reproduces, is to Abandon the Windsor Framework. 2. Mutual Enforcement: TUV advocates for Mutual Enforcement as a means of protecting the integrity of the EU single market while avoiding a hard border across the island of Ireland and avoiding the disenfranchisement of NI citizens. This involves the UK enforcing its legislation to ensure UK-made goods destined for the Republic meet ROI standards, and the Republic doing the same for Irish goods entering the UK. 3. Restoration of Consent: TUV stresses the need to restore the basic principles of cross community consent as it affects the Protocol. The removal of the need for cross-community assent in the upcoming vote on the Protocol is called an \"egregious assault\" on unionism and the Stormont system’s equilibrium. 4. Campaigning Strategy: TUV Reform MPs would relentlessly argue that the current arrangement is politically unsustainable, especially since the EU has alternative options (Mutual Enforcement) that do not involve disenfranchising 1.9 million people.",
          "entire manifesto": "The TUV Manifesto for 2024 focuses heavily on constitutional matters, particularly the Northern Ireland Protocol, alongside economic, social, and public service policies, many of which are aligned with their common platform with Reform UK. Here is a summary of the manifesto’s key policies: 1. The Union and the Protocol (Core Mission) The overriding mission of the TUV is the reunification of the UK and the restoration of the Union. • Rejection of the Sea Border: TUV campaigns against the Irish Sea border and the subjection of Northern Ireland (NI) to EU law and the ECJ (European Court of Justice). They assert that the Protocol has \"splintered our union with GB\" and makes NI a \"condominium,\" ruled partly by UK laws and partly by foreign EU laws. • Constitutional Sovereignty: The manifesto states that Westminster is no longer sovereign over NI due to the surrender of powers to a foreign parliament. They note that NI citizens have no say in over 300 areas of law decided by the EU. • Protocol as a Catalyst for Unity: TUV believes the Protocol is a dynamo for Irish unity through dynamic economic alignment with the Republic of Ireland. • Full Brexit: They advocate for the completion of a full Brexit so that the United Kingdom in all its parts enjoys full independence and economic freedom. • The Solution: Mutual Enforcement: TUV proposes \"Mutual Enforcement\" as a means of protecting the integrity of the EU single market without imposing a hard border on the island of Ireland or disenfranchising NI citizens. • Consent and Devolution: TUV demands the restoration of consent and cross-community consent as it affects the Protocol, arguing that the removal of this requirement is an egregious assault on the Stormont modus operandi. • Immigration Sovereignty: They highlight that because of the Protocol and the supremacy of EU law, the UK Government’s Rwanda Bill cannot apply in Northern Ireland, making NI a potential \"magnet for illegal migrants\". 2. Economy and Cost of Living (Shared with Reform UK) TUV shares the Reform UK approach to the economy. Personal Economy: • Income Tax: Lift the Income Tax Start Point to £20,000 per year, freeing up to 7 million people from paying Income Tax and saving every worker almost £1,500 annually. The higher tax rate should begin at £70,000. • Energy Costs: Cut Energy Taxes to save households over £500 per year by lowering fuel duty by 20p per litre, and scrapping VAT on energy bills and environmental levies. • Housing Market: Substantially boost housebuilding and economic activity by cutting Residential Stamp Duty to 0% below £750k. • Tourism: Abolish the VAT Tourist Tax (stopping the VAT refund scheme for tourist shopping). Business Economy: • Corporation Tax: Free over 1.2 million small and medium-sized businesses from Corporation Tax by raising the minimum profit threshold to £100k. Reduce the main Corporation Tax Rate from 25% to 20%, then to 15% from Year 3. • SME Support: Abolish Business Rates for high street based SMEs and offset this by introducing an Online Delivery Tax at 4% for large, multinational enterprises. • Self-Employment and Tax: Abolish IR35 Rules to support sole traders and raise the VAT Threshold to £150,000. 3. Immigration (Shared with Reform UK) TUV supports a robust migration policy across the whole of the UK. • Freeze Non-Essential Immigration: Strict limits on immigration, with essential skills (mainly healthcare) as the only exception. • Stop the Boats: Implement a four-point plan, including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), ensuring zero illegal immigrants are resettled in the UK, returning illegal migrants to France, and secure detention for all illegal migrants. • Benefits Access: Impose a requirement of 5 years residency and employment to claim any benefits in the UK. • Employer Immigration Tax: Raise the National Insurance rate to 20% for foreign workers (exempting essential foreign health/care workers and businesses with five staff or fewer) to incentivize employing British citizens. 4. Health and Social Services TUV emphasizes sustaining long-term investment in health, prioritizing it over spending on items like Casement Park or \"rights agendas\". • Staffing and Investment: Fund more nurses, doctors, and beds. • NHS Loyalty: Disincentivize the reliance on agency staff and reward loyalty to the NHS. • Nursing Reserve: Campaign for the creation of a Nursing Reserve Service (akin to the Army Reserve) using retired and former nurses available in emergencies. • Accessibility: Oppose the closure of minor injuries units and local facilities. They seek to restore a readily accessible GP service. • Mental Health: Support increased funding for Community Mental Health services and ensuring adequate acute psychiatric beds are available within patients’ Trust areas. • Pro-Life Stance: TUV is unashamedly pro-life and opposes the full commissioning of abortion services, aiming to halt the destruction of the unborn. 5. Education and Childcare • Educational Underachievement: TUV’s number one priority is tackling educational underachievement, particularly for the Protestant working class. • Academic Selection: Commitment to academic selection while also creating a more equal system of exceptional Grammar and non-selective schools. • Curriculum: Proposals include an evidence-informed curriculum overhaul and investment in teacher recruitment and fair pay. • Childcare Funding: TUV demands that the money allocated by Westminster for childcare (Barnett Consequentials) be spent on childcare, noting that over £32 million allocated for 2024-25 is currently being spent elsewhere. 6. Justice, Policing, and Legacy • Policing: They demand an end to blatant two-tier policing and insist on PSNI recruitment based on merit, with no return to 50/50 practices. • Legacy: TUV believes the definition of \"victim\" must be changed to exclude victim makers. • Amnesty: There can be no amnesty for historic crimes, and TUV opposes the Legacy Act. • Terrorism Glorification: Legislation on the glorification of terrorism needs to be revisited and applied equally across the UK. 7. Social and Fundamental Freedoms TUV stands up for traditional family values. • Gender and Identity: TUV believes that gender is determined at birth and actively opposes the \"progressive\" agenda regarding gender identity in schools. • Women’s Rights: They oppose biological males being permitted to access women’s only spaces, using \"gender-neutral\" changing areas, or competing in female sports events. • Sanctity of Life: TUV is pro-life and opposes abortion on demand and euthanasia. • Religious Freedom: TUV will oppose moves to dilute fundamental human rights such as religious belief, teaching, and practice, and defends freedom of expression and conscience. 8. Other Key Policies • Stormont Reform: Given minimal faith in Stormont’s ability to deliver, TUV’s default position is British rule from Westminster over Sinn Fein rule from Stormont. • Fair Funding: TUV will fight for a fair financial funding deal for Northern Ireland, ensuring the funding formula is updated to account for local needs. • Agriculture: TUV opposes the EU threat to veterinary medicines. They will continue to protect farming interests by opposing the pursuit of anti-farming ideology associated with climate change activists and net zero demands. • Senior Citizens: TUV will work to maintain the triple lock on state pensions. • Sport and Tourism: TUV opposes the use of public funds for the Casement Park project. They will fight for the right of NI athletes in all sports to compete for the United Kingdom and contend in favour of the playing of the National Anthem at major sporting events. They also seek to remove constraints that prevent Tourism NI from promoting Northern Ireland in Great Britain. The core thrust of the manifesto is the defense of the Union and democratic accountability, framing the constitutional issues—particularly the existence of the Sea Border—as the underlying factor impacting NI’s economy, immigration policy, and the cost of living."

      "Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)": [
        {
          "crime": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Manifesto sets out key policies on crime under the commitment \"Standing Up for Victims of Crime\". These policies focus on addressing online harm, tackling the legacy of the Troubles, ensuring adequate policing resources, and strengthening sentences for serious offenses. Key Policies on Crime and Justice: 1. Standing Up for Victims of Crime and Legacy Issues The DUP strongly advocates for a victim-centered approach to addressing the Troubles and is committed to repealing the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023. The party argues that this Act grants an \"amnesty in all but name\" to perpetrators, extinguishing the flame of justice for many innocent victims. Specific actions include: • Supporting efforts to repeal the Legacy Act and urging UK Ministers to repeal it within the first 100 days of the next Parliament. • Prioritizing a victim-centred and victim-led approach to investigating the past. • Guaranteeing continued funding for the Troubles victims’ pension, ensuring no money is given to perpetrators. • Seeking a UK-wide definition of a victim that rejects any equivalence between the perpetrator and the victim. • Pressing for further progress by the Omagh Public Inquiry and challenging the Irish Government to launch its own public inquiry into the Omagh atrocity. • Supporting stronger custodial sentences for murder and terror offenses in Northern Ireland, bringing sentencing in line with other UK regions. 2. Online Harm and Social Media Regulation The DUP seeks to \"end the ‘Wild West’ of social media\" and protect all internet users, particularly children, from harm, abuse, and misinformation. The party supported key aspects of the Online Safety Act, including age verification for certain sites, duties on platforms to remove harmful content, and new criminal offenses for actions like trolling and cyber-flashing. Future policy proposals include: • Campaigning to ensure smaller and emerging social media platforms and sites hosting harmful content are subject to regulatory controls and Ofcom oversight. • Opposing a lower minimum age for social media use. • Promoting strategies to reduce the risks of end-to-end encryption for children. • Seeking a statutory definition of grooming. • Supporting a rapid review of emerging risks from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including chatbots. • Supporting the ring-fencing of receipts from fines levied on social media companies for online harm prevention and reduction. 3. Policing and Security The DUP highlights the need for a fully staffed and properly resourced police service in Northern Ireland (NI), noting a \"steady decline\" in policing budgets compared to the health and education sectors. They stress that the current number of 6,400 police officers is unsustainable and that the next Government must prioritize safety through a fair fiscal framework. Specific policies on policing and security include: • Advocating for an uplift in Government funding for Northern Ireland’s Additional Security needs and the Tackling Paramilitarism Programme. • Seeking a statutory definition of Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE) to better target paramilitaries and crime gangs who prey on children. • Campaigning to strengthen the role of the National Crime Agency in NI. • Seeking to protect neighborhood policing resources. • Regarding Northern Ireland-Related Terrorism, they support ensuring security forces have the necessary powers and autonomy to defeat dissident republican groups. They also want to address lengthy delays in trying terrorism cases. 4. Justice System and Court Reform The DUP is pushing for measures to streamline the justice system and ensure consistent sentencing across the UK. Justice policies include: • Pressing for stronger custodial sentences for murder and terror offences in NI, ensuring consistency with other UK regions. • Seeking to try terrorism cases faster, which would reduce costs related to suspects spending long periods on remand. • Supporting the establishment of a Royal Commission into the effectiveness of the criminal justice system across the UK. • Promoting tougher sentencing for physical assaults on retail staff. • Supporting robust animal welfare legislation, including voting for stronger custodial sentencing for animal cruelty in England and Wales to align with the five-year maximum penalty already in place in Northern Ireland. 5. Violence Against Women & Girls (VAWG) The DUP commits to addressing gaps in funding for specialist support for survivors of domestic abuse, supporting robust and up-to-date vetting in police forces, and seeking an improved response to trolling and other forms of technology-facilitated abuse against women online. They also call for a review of policies affecting migrants with \"No Recourse to Public Funds\" (NRPF) who suffer domestic abuse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The DUP’s focus on crime and justice reflects a dual commitment: ensuring Northern Ireland has a functional, well-funded modern police and court system, and maintaining a firm stance against attempts to minimize accountability for Troubles-era crimes. This is evident in their push to repeal the Legacy Act while simultaneously advocating for better resources to combat current threats like paramilitary crime and online harm.",
          "healthcare": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) details its key healthcare policies under its commitment \"Putting You First - Delivering Fair and Equitable Funding for our NHS, and other Public Services\". The party views the National Health Service (NHS) as the \"jewel in the crown of the Union\" and stresses the need to prioritize it across the United Kingdom. The DUP’s healthcare strategy focuses heavily on securing equitable funding, tackling waiting lists, supporting healthcare staff, and maintaining a pro-life stance. Key Policies on Healthcare: 1. Fair and Equitable Funding for the NHS The DUP asserts that chronic underfunding from Westminster has systematically damaged Northern Ireland’s capacity to provide fit-for-purpose frontline services. The party has campaigned extensively for a new needs-based funding model for Northern Ireland. The DUP commits to pressing the next Government to ensure that funding for Northern Ireland’s public services, including the NHS, cannot drop below the definition of assessed need, which they define as £124 for every £100 spent in England. They also campaign for Northern Ireland’s baseline funding to be increased proportionally by the same amount above need as was applied to Wales, which included a new needs-based factor and a 5% transitional uplift. 2. Improving Access and Driving Down Waiting Lists A major focus is improving patient access to NHS services and treatments across the UK, which has historically included campaigning on rare diseases and securing access to treatments like the drug Orkambi for Cystic Fibrosis sufferers. Going forward, DUP MPs will campaign to: • Drive waiting lists down by fostering large-scale partnerships between health and social care in Northern Ireland and national independent providers or not-for-profit organizations. • Ensure accessible and portable health information throughout a patient’s life. • Establish clusters of universities, business, and clinicians throughout the UK to harness and accelerate the use of new medical technology and diagnostics. 3. Supporting Healthcare Professionals The DUP recognizes the need to end disparities in arrangements benefitting health staff in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK, which is essential for primary care delivery and skills retention. Specific proposals for supporting GPs and public sector staff include: • Providing fellowships for young GPs in substantive posts. • Commissioning a practitioner health scheme. • Providing a permanent state-backed scheme for indemnity for GPs. • Ensuring a fair and equitable approach to pensions and residence for qualified GPs seeking to live and work in the United Kingdom. • Campaigning for recurrent funding to provide decent pay awards for public sector staff, including nurses and doctors, noting that public sector pay has not kept pace with other parts of the UK due to chronic underfunding. • Supporting strategies to improve occupational support and attract, recruit, train, and retain frontline staff. • Seeking to make it easier for international students qualifying in primary care roles, such as GPs, to gain permanent residence, helping the Health Service benefit from increased training places. 4. End-of-Life Care and Terminal Illnesses The DUP is committed to improving care and support for those with a terminal illness. DUP MPs have supported: • A change in the law to allow those with a life expectancy of up to 12 months to get faster and easier access to certain benefits and pensions. • Promoting better quality and better access to palliative care. • Continuing to press for enhanced provision for families affected by terminal diagnoses. 5. Moral and Social Health Issues The DUP maintains an \"unashamedly pro-life stance\" and commits to firmly opposing efforts to legalize assisted suicide. They have consistently opposed the commissioning of, and funding for, abortion services in Northern Ireland. They also oppose regulations that mandate the inclusion of abortion in the Relationships and Sexuality Education curriculum in schools. The party also supports measures to tackle the harm caused by smoking and vaping, including exploring options such as raising the age of sale to 21, while adding that any restriction on the right of adults to make choices must always be justified. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In essence, the DUP views increased and stable UK funding for Northern Ireland’s NHS as the critical foundation for solving persistent issues like staff retention and excessive waiting lists, while simultaneously advocating for better care and maintaining their moral stance on life issues.",
          "housing": "Based on the provided sources from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Manifesto, the party’s key policies on housing are primarily framed within the context of their delivery record in the Northern Ireland Assembly and their commitment to supporting families and vulnerable people. While housing is not one of the ten core policy commitments at the General Election , the manifesto highlights specific achievements and proposals related to housing and home ownership in Northern Ireland, mainly through the actions of the DUP Department for Communities Minister at the Assembly. Key Policies and Delivered Outcomes on Housing: 1. Affordable Housing Supply The DUP Minister for Communities announced measures to increase the supply of affordable housing for rent in Northern Ireland. • Intermediate Rent Product: The DUP launched the \"Intermediate Rent\" product. This involves offering a long-term low-interest loan to an operator to develop a new supply of affordable homes for rent at a 20% discount off market value. 2. Supporting Home Ownership The party aims to support more people in achieving home ownership: • Co-Ownership Housing: The DUP introduced a measure to support people into home ownership by increasing the upper property value limit for Co-Ownership Housing. 3. Protection for Homeowners (Defective Premises) The DUP has focused on ensuring legal protections for homeowners regarding defective premises: • Defective Premises Legislation: Legislation was introduced by accelerated passage to ensure homeowners in Northern Ireland enjoy the same protections offered elsewhere in the UK, citing the case of Victoria Square apartments as a highlight. 4. Addressing Building Safety (Post-Grenfell) In their record of delivery at Westminster, DUP Parliamentarians successfully lobbied the Department for Levelling Up and Department for Communities to fund and launch a scheme to address Non-ACM (Aluminium Composite Material) cladded buildings in Northern Ireland, post-Grenfell. 5. Support for Vulnerable People Beyond housing construction, the party allocated additional funding in 2023/24 for the Supporting People Programme, which helps vulnerable people to live independently. 6. Managing Housing Demand (Immigration) The DUP also notes a policy focus related to the impact of immigration on housing needs: • They support a review of the impact of the Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contracts on housing need and public services in all UK regions. 7. Promoting Jobs and Growth (Supporting Construction) While not exclusively a housing policy, the DUP supports the creation of a national database of public land. A major benefit of this database would be to help smaller businesses in the construction industry identify future projects earlier.",
          "immigration": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) addresses its key policies on immigration and asylum within its commitment to \"A Strategic Role for UK Defence and Security\". The party’s stance emphasizes achieving a single, controlled immigration system that applies uniformly across the United Kingdom, specifically protecting Northern Ireland from becoming a destination for illegal migrants due to the impact of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Key Policies on Immigration and Asylum: 1. Uniform Application of UK Immigration Policy The DUP supports a firm, fair, and controlled immigration system where rules are governed solely by the UK Parliament and are fully applicable in all parts of the United Kingdom. • The party will fight to ensure national immigration and asylum policy applies equally across the United Kingdom by restoring Parliamentary sovereignty over the law in Northern Ireland. • The DUP points out that courts have ruled the Government’s policy on sending illegal migrants to Rwanda cannot extend to Northern Ireland due to Article 2 of the Protocol, which the DUP argues risks making Northern Ireland a magnet for asylum seekers seeking to escape enforcement. 2. Addressing Illegal Immigration and Asylum Claims The DUP supports an approach that allows those fleeing war or persecution to find refuge in the UK, provided it is underpinned by effective measures to deter illegal activity and improve processing efficiency. • The party advocates for renewed efforts to smash and deter crime gangs who profit from illegal and unsafe transports across the Channel. • They call for speedier and more efficient processes for dealing with asylum claims. • They also support reviewing the impact of the Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contracts on housing need and public services in all UK regions. • The DUP continues to call on the Government to ensure that all Afghan citizens who risked their lives to assist the Armed Forces against the Taliban are urgently resettled in the UK and do not face deportation while seeking asylum. 3. Agile and Responsive Migration System for Labour Needs The DUP acknowledges that the current system of work visas has proven ineffective in responding to the pressing needs of businesses, particularly in Northern Ireland where there are concerns about labour shortages in key industries like agri-food and hospitality. The party supports promoting a more agile and responsive migration system. Specific proposals to address labour needs include: • Seeking a review of the structure and operation of the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), including considering formal representation from the devolved regions. A reformed MAC should work with a new Independent Skills Commission to map and meet labour shortages across the UK. • Seeking to ensure fair minimum salary thresholds for skilled overseas workers to protect sectors like food production, manufacturing, hospitality, and health and social care. The current threshold of £38,700 is highlighted as being \"well above the average salary in NI\". • Advocating for a multi-year rolling seasonal workers scheme for agriculture with a suitable length visa. • Seeking to make it easier for international students qualifying in primary care roles, such as GPs, to gain permanent residence, ensuring the Health Service can benefit from increasing training places. In summary, the DUP’s immigration policy is driven by two main priorities: ensuring Northern Ireland is fully integrated into and protected by a robust, national UK immigration policy, and reforming the migration system to be more responsive to the specific labour market needs of the local economy.",
          "defence": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) views UK defence and security as a strategic necessity, emphasizing the need to strengthen military capabilities, significantly increase spending, and fully integrate Northern Ireland into the national defence structures and supply chains. The DUP’s stance on defence, drawing directly from the sources, can be summarized under several key areas: Defence Strategy and Spending The DUP stresses that defence expenditure must be viewed as a benefit rather than a burden : • Need for Strength: The party believes there is a critical need to strengthen the United Kingdom’s defence industrial base and grow the Armed Forces. • Geopolitical Threats: The DUP cites global threats, including Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the proliferation of cyber threats from China, Iran, and North Korea, as demonstrating the importance of the UK being equipped with military and intelligence capabilities to protect national interests. • Spending Target: They advocate that the UK should immediately increase defence spending and commit to allocating 3.0% of GDP on defence by 2035. • NATO and Sovereignty: They support the UK’s unshakeable commitment to NATO and continued cooperation with key strategic partners (like supporting Ukraine). However, they also emphasize the need for the UK to be able to stand on its own feet and retain sovereign strategic and operational independence. • Nuclear Deterrent: The DUP supports increased spending to safeguard the UK’s nuclear deterrent. Integrating Northern Ireland into UK Defence A primary objective is to fully integrate Northern Ireland into the UK’s defence network, capitalizing on the region’s industrial base: • Integration: DUP MPs will pursue the greater integration of Northern Ireland into national defence structures, networks, and operations, consistent with the principle of consent and the Belfast Agreement. • Presence and Deterrence: They support calls for an increased RAF and Royal Navy presence in Northern Ireland to fortify the northwestern naval and air patrol presence. This presence would act as a deterrent against threats, such as attempts by Russia to target critical western undersea infrastructure. • Defence Industry Investment: The aerospace, defence, security, and space sectors in Northern Ireland (including companies like Spirit AeroSystems, Thales, and Harland & Wolff) thrive and are vital for jobs. DUP MPs have highlighted that Ministry of Defence (MoD) expenditure per person in Northern Ireland (£100) is disproportionately low compared to other regions (e.g., £380 regional average). • Specific Industrial Goals: The party aims to increase the number of major MoD contracts placed in Northern Ireland and encourage MoD support for the creation of an official defence and security cluster in the region. They also push for the government to expedite a review into public and commercial awareness of the Northern Ireland defence sector. • Skills Pipeline: The DUP seeks to ensure future skills policies prioritize a steady pipeline of apprenticeships and highly-qualified graduates in STEM subjects to generate military and security capabilities. They want Northern Ireland’s industrial base to benefit from economic opportunities provided by investment in the nuclear deterrent. Armed Forces and Veterans Support The DUP is a consistent advocate for veterans and serving personnel from Northern Ireland : • Armed Forces Covenant: DUP MPs supported the Armed Forces Act 2021 to ensure the Armed Forces Covenant was legally protected in Northern Ireland. They also insisted on the appointment of a Northern Ireland Veterans’ Commissioner. • Future Support: They intend to explore the potential expansion of the Armed Forces Covenant Duty to cover employment, pensions, social care, and criminal justice. • Compensation: They call for the government to consider disregarding War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Scheme as income from benefits and pensions. • Afghan Citizens: They continue to call on the Government to ensure that all Afghan citizens who assisted the Armed Forces are urgently resettled in the UK. Combating Northern Ireland-Related Terrorism The DUP emphasizes the necessity of a strong focus on countering domestic threats: • Sustained Focus: They note the enduring threat posed by dissident republicans and welcome the national intelligence community’s role in eroding the capabilities of splinter groups like the New IRA. • Security Funding: They will advocate for an uplift in funding provided by the Government for Northern Ireland’s additional security needs. • Justice and Sentencing: The party aims to address lengthy delays in trying terrorism cases. They believe sentences for serious terror offences in Northern Ireland should be brought into line with higher tariffs elsewhere in the United Kingdom to ensure consistency of sentencing principles throughout the UK. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The DUP’s view on defence is akin to demanding that all the strategic components of a sophisticated national shield are equally sourced and supported across the entire country. They argue that Northern Ireland is a critical manufacturing, strategic, and personnel hub that has been historically underutilized and underfunded by the Ministry of Defence, and they are committed to ensuring it receives equitable status and investment in the national security framework.",
          "economy": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) details its economic vision under the core commitment \"Unleashing our Full Economic Potential,\" aiming for an ambitious approach to creating more and better jobs and generating greater prosperity for the people of Northern Ireland. The DUP seeks to consolidate Northern Ireland’s place as a global destination for investment within the United Kingdom. The economic policies focus on supporting Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), reforming the tax system, promoting key sectors like advanced manufacturing and hydrogen technology, addressing skills shortages, and improving access to finance. Key Policies on the Economy: 1. Taxation and Fiscal Policy The DUP seeks tax policies that protect incomes, ensure fairness, and leave more money with working people. • Income and National Insurance: The party campaigns to oppose the freeze on the personal tax allowance and higher rate income tax threshold. They also seek further reductions in national insurance, building on recent cuts, and support an increase in the starting age for employee national insurance. • VAT: The DUP seeks to abolish VAT on domestic electricity bills. They also continue to campaign for a reduction in VAT for hospitality across the United Kingdom to address the competitive disadvantage faced by local businesses due to a reduced rate in the Republic of Ireland. • Fuel Duty and Vehicle Tax: They commit to maintaining the freeze on fuel duty and freezing Vehicle Excise Duty. • Corporation Tax: Although they maintain that the necessary capacity does not exist for the devolution of additional fiscal powers at this time , lowering the rate of corporation tax in Northern Ireland is a longstanding DUP policy. They advocate for a reduction in corporate tax across the United Kingdom. The current minimum effective rate of 15% in the Irish Republic is noted as placing Northern Ireland firms at a competitive disadvantage. 2. Supporting Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) The DUP aims to address challenges threatening the survival of SMEs and help them reach their full potential. • VAT Threshold: Campaigning to increase the VAT threshold for SMEs to £100,000 and then uprate it in line with inflation. • Support and Procurement: Driving up the number of SMEs benefiting from government procurement spend, tax reliefs, and business support. • Late Payments and Insurance: Protecting cash flow by tackling late payments to small suppliers in government contracts. They will support a market review into professional indemnity insurance (PII). • Online Sales Tax: Exploring the potential introduction of an online sales tax targeting online corporates and marketplaces to address the issue of online giants undercutting high street shops. • Access to Finance: Supporting the extension of the Growth Guarantee Scheme for the duration of the next Parliament, which provides a 70% guarantee to lenders on finance provided to SMEs. They also support a review of small business lending, assessing the impact of unnecessary personal guarantees on SME investment. 3. Strategic Sector Growth and Investment The DUP is focused on maximizing the potential of key economic sectors. • Advanced Manufacturing: Pressing for a new national industrial strategy that prioritizes advanced manufacturing, engineering, digital, agri-tech, life and health sciences, and fintech. They also press the Government to retain the Full Expensing rules for capital investment. • Hydrogen Technology: Committed to maximizing economic and social opportunities associated with hydrogen technology, in which Northern Ireland is seen as an innovator. They will seek a dedicated Hydrogen Innovation Strategy, support a new green hydrogen apprenticeship programme, and consider funding streams and incentives for SME innovation in this sector. • Research and Development (R&D): Backing proposals to increase the official UK R&D spend target to at least 3.0% of GDP by 2027 and to expand R&D tax relief for SMEs to include capital expenditure. 4. Skills and Labour Market The party believes a failure to invest in skills holds the economy back. • Skills Commission: Supporting the establishment of an Independent UK Skills Commission with representation for Northern Ireland, tasked with assessing current and future labour needs and scrutinizing policy. • Apprenticeships: Committed to replacing the Apprenticeship Levy with a new system that ensures contributions are ringfenced and reinvested in skills. They seek to deliver more all-age, public sector, and SME-led apprenticeships. • Migration System: Promoting a more agile and responsive migration system to address labour shortages in key industries like agri-food and hospitality. They seek fair minimum salary thresholds for skilled overseas workers to protect these sectors, noting the current threshold of £38,700 is \"well above the average salary in NI\". 5. Infrastructure and Connectivity The DUP highlights high-quality infrastructure as the foundation of future growth. • Union Connectivity Review (UCR): Pursuing the full implementation of the UCR to improve links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This includes secured commitments to improving journeys on the A75 in Scotland and boosting port connections and infrastructure between NI and GB. • Air Travel: Advocating for the abolition of domestic air passenger duty to boost the competitiveness of Northern Ireland’s airports. • Broadband and 5G: Building on their record of securing full-fibre broadband, the DUP seeks to accelerate the roll-out of 5G coverage in Northern Ireland. The DUP’s economic policy is anchored in the idea that Northern Ireland’s economic potential is best realized through its role as an integrated part of the UK, arguing that the UK needs all its constituent parts to flourish. Their policy platform attempts to use tax breaks and strategic investment to boost local businesses and highly productive sectors like advanced manufacturing.",
          "education": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Manifesto outlines several key policies and highlights recent achievements in the education sector, focusing on improving conditions for teachers and support staff, increasing investment in infrastructure, addressing special educational needs, and supporting early learning and childcare. These policies are predominantly detailed under the \"Delivering for Northern Ireland in the Assembly\" section, reflecting the party’s work in the devolved government. Key Policies and Outcomes on Education: 1. Teacher and Staff Compensation The DUP has focused on resolving long-running disputes regarding pay and grading to improve recruitment and retention: • Teacher Pay: The DUP settled the long-running industrial action by teachers and successfully increased the starting salary for teachers in Northern Ireland to £30,000. • Support Staff Pay: The party committed to resolving the pay and grading review for educational support staff, including classroom assistants. • Public Sector Pay: More broadly, the DUP campaigns for recurrent funding to provide decent pay awards for public sector staff like teachers, arguing that pay awards have not kept pace with other parts of the United Kingdom due to chronic underfunding. 2. Capital Investment and Infrastructure The DUP has secured and announced significant investment for school facilities: • Capital Funding: An additional £80 million of capital funding for education was announced for the current year. This will allow fifteen important new build, extension, and refurbishment projects for schools across all sectors to proceed to construction. A new programme of curriculum-led investment was also launched. • Strule Shared Education Campus: Secured Executive agreement to provide £150 million of earmarked additional funding over the next three years to deliver the Strule Shared Education Campus in Omagh. This project aims to bring together 4,000 children and young people from all community backgrounds on a vibrant and dynamic education campus. 3. Special Educational Needs (SEN) The DUP announced a major step change in planning and investment for children with special educational needs: • Investment Programme: They announced an ambitious and far-reaching programme of investment in facilities for children with special educational needs, intended to transform the education and lives of these vulnerable children and their families. 4. Early Learning and Childcare Recognizing that the lack of affordable childcare negatively impacts parental employment, the DUP is addressing this through a package of measures: • Funding Package: An interim £25 million package of measures was announced to support children, parents, and providers with early learning and childcare starting in September. • Pre-School Education: The measures aim to offer all children 22.5 hours of pre-school education per week. • Childcare Subsidy: The package is designed to reduce childcare bills for working parents through a Northern Ireland Childcare Subsidy Scheme. • Tax-Free Childcare: At Westminster, DUP MPs will support increasing the Tax-Free Childcare allowance from 20% to 35% and removing the cap on Tax Free Childcare above £2,000. 5. Other Education-Related Policies • School Uniforms: A consultation on improving the affordability of school uniforms was launched, and DUP MPs have proposed scrapping VAT on school uniforms. • Curriculum and Achievement: A £20 million programme of investment was announced to deliver innovative and community-informed approaches to raise achievement and reduce educational disadvantage in Northern Ireland. • Religious Freedom/RSE: The DUP has opposed regulations foisting abortion on the Relationships and Sexuality Education curriculum in schools across Northern Ireland. • Educational Opportunities: DUP MPs will campaign to deliver increased economic and educational opportunities for young people by building relationships across the UK, including through the UK East-West Council. • British Sign Language: DUP MPs supported plans to consult on the introduction of British Sign Language as a GCSE qualification in schools in England, while campaigning for similar steps to be considered in Northern Ireland. • School Management: A new way forward on how controlled schools are managed by the Education Authority was announced. Overall, the DUP’s education policies emphasize increased funding and investment to stabilize the sector, address long-standing pay issues, and ensure vulnerable children and families have access to necessary educational support and affordable childcare.",
          "environment": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) outlines its key environmental policies under the commitment \"Leading a Fairer - Not Faster - Path Towards Net-Zero\". The party supports the UK’s long-term net-zero ambitions but emphasizes that the transition must be fair, inclusive, and should not lead to disproportionate costs for families and businesses. Summary of Key Policies on the Environment: 1. Fairer Transition to Net-Zero and Climate Policy The DUP is concerned that recent climate legislation, including in Northern Ireland, has been rushed and conflicts with independent scientific advice. Their primary focus is on mitigating the economic impact of environmental policy: • Fair Transition: They will press for a truly fair transition that is inclusive of all communities, households, and industries. • Cost Mitigation: They aim to address the threat of increased costs for basic goods and services and the looming impact of changes to emissions trading schemes and the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. • National Approach: They believe a national approach to the co-design, delivery, and monitoring of climate policy is crucial, along with an enforcement approach that provides a level playing field across the United Kingdom. 2. Protecting Rivers and Lakes (Lough Neagh Crisis) The DUP acknowledges the ecological crisis engulfing Northern Ireland’s rivers and lakes, asserting that the natural environment cannot be ignored. • Pollution and Water Quality: There must be a concerted effort to tackle the sources of pollution, protect habitats, prevent biodiversity loss, and preserve water quality in Lough Neagh and rivers throughout Northern Ireland. • Action Plan: DUP MPs will support: ◦ A multi-agency response and approach to the ecological crisis in Lough Neagh. ◦ Targeted initiatives to prevent pollutants from entering waterways. ◦ Enforcement action against those who repeatedly or deliberately pollute rivers or lakes. 3. Green Growth and Low-Carbon Economy The DUP integrates environmental progress with economic opportunity, supporting policies that foster green, clean, and inclusive growth. • Economic Goals: They support the ambition of creating more local green jobs and aim to double the size of Northern Ireland’s low carbon and renewable energy economy to more than £2 billion turnover. • Hydrogen Technology: Northern Ireland is recognized as an innovator in hydrogen technology. The DUP commits to maximizing opportunities associated with hydrogen through a dedicated Hydrogen Innovation Strategy, supporting a new green hydrogen apprenticeship programme, and seeking funding streams and incentives for SME innovation in this sector. 4. Energy and Transportation The DUP supports a transition to cleaner energy but seeks pragmatic approaches to manage the shift, especially regarding personal vehicles and heating: • Energy Security: They remain committed to phasing out fossil fuels, acknowledging that two-thirds of homes in Northern Ireland are still heated by oil. They support a strategic national approach to transforming the production of clean and renewable energy in all parts of the UK. • Petrol/Diesel Ban Review: The DUP supports pushing back the ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles to at least 2035. They believe there should be a further review of these plans to account for the high upfront costs for families, the practical impact on businesses, and the lack of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure availability. • Active Travel: They will support improved, structured working among government levels to enhance active travel infrastructure. 5. Waste and Circular Economy The party supports policies that promote a circular economy by keeping waste within the economy and out of the landscape, but opposes overly complex household sorting schemes. • Waste Collection: The DUP opposes a costly move to require households to sort waste into as many as six bins. Instead, they support a uniform method for household waste collection in Northern Ireland to keep it simple, maximize recycling volumes, and promote innovation in sorting technology. • Funding and Support: They will work with the next Government to unlock funding for the circular economy in Northern Ireland through the National Interdisciplinary Circular Economy Research (NICER) programme and encourage businesses to adopt circular business models. 6. Farming and Environmental Policy The DUP links environmental regulation to agricultural policy, stressing the protection of local food production: • Trade Risks: They express concern that unfair and unworkable environmental targets levied on local farm businesses may lead to a reliance on foreign, cheaper produce that may have been farmed under lower environmental standards. • Trade Protection: They will seek protection for sensitive food and animal products in trade negotiations. • Planning Policy: They seek a national review of planning policy and law to unlock greater levels of on-farm investment, including ensuring rules around permitted development and ammonia emissions adopt a long-term approach to delivering more sustainable farming practices. The DUP generally accepts the goal of Net-Zero but insists that the implementation must be tempered by economic practicality, avoiding burdensome costs on households and businesses, especially in Northern Ireland.",
          "brexit": "The sources, which are excerpts from the Democratic Unionist Party’s (DUP) 2024 Manifesto, primarily focus on the negative impacts of the Northern Ireland Protocol and the party’s ongoing campaign to remove internal barriers within the United Kingdom post-Brexit. The DUP’s core views on Brexit arrangements, particularly concerning Northern Ireland, can be summarized as follows: Stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol and EU Law The DUP strongly opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol and views its imposition as a catastrophic political failure: • The Northern Ireland Protocol was imposed without the support of any elected unionist representative. • The Protocol wrecked the settled political balance within Northern Ireland and led directly to a loss of unionist confidence. • The DUP voted against the imposition of the NI Protocol in both the UK national Parliament and the European Parliament. • The party states that some of the greatest harm inflicted on Northern Ireland has been a consequence of choices made by the Conservative Party and endorsed by the national Parliament. • A key objective is to remove the application of EU law in Northern Ireland and to eliminate the internal Irish Sea border that the Protocol created. • The DUP is campaigning to send a strong message to the next Government that they will continue to fight to fully restore Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom. • They will continue to argue for the full primacy of the United Kingdom internal market and will reject its undermining. View of the Windsor Framework and Negotiations While the DUP acknowledges some progress was made in subsequent negotiations, they did not endorse the resulting deal: • The DUP did not support the Windsor Framework, despite recognizing that some progress had been secured. • The party decided to return to Stormont on the basis of the roadmap set out in the Government’s Command Paper, but noted that this paper did not secure all of their negotiating objectives and failed to remedy a number of the long-term problems born out of the Protocol. • Important gains secured through negotiations included: ◦ Parliament legislating for mutual recognition of standards on goods through a goods guarantee throughout the United Kingdom. ◦ The creation of the new U.K East-West Council to foster deeper connections across trade, transport, education, and culture. ◦ The establishment of Intertrade UK to boost trade and remove internal barriers throughout the United Kingdom. ◦ Securing the Stormont Brake mechanism, which the DUP states they pushed for and will use to full effect. Future Action and Commitments The DUP remains committed to overturning the current arrangements: • The party plans to use the inbuilt review mechanisms and will not hesitate to vote against the continued application of the current arrangements in the NI Assembly vote in October. • They are committed to securing a practical and ongoing demonstration from future UK Governments of their commitment to promoting and developing British culture, heritage, and traditions, recognizing that the Protocol has acutely impacted confidence in unionist and loyalist communities. • The DUP secured a government commitment to improving connections between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, including through the A75 in Scotland and £10 million for port infrastructure development. Related Post-Brexit Policy Positions The DUP also notes specific areas where UK sovereignty post-Brexit is relevant: • Immigration: The party supported an end to the free movement of people from European countries and seeks a fair and controlled immigration system governed solely by the UK Parliament and equally and fully applicable in all parts of the United Kingdom. They specifically highlight that Article 2 of the Protocol prevents the Government’s policy on illegal migrants (like the Rwanda plan) from extending to Northern Ireland, risking making the region a \"magnet for asylum seekers\". • Fisheries: Northern Ireland fishermen have benefited from leaving the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which ended discrimination that saw quotas effectively \"stolen\" from Northern Ireland fishermen and awarded to competitors in the Irish Republic. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To understand the DUP’s stance, imagine trying to unite a room that has been cut in half by a temporary, unpopular wall. The DUP’s view is that the wall (the Protocol/Irish Sea border) should never have been built, they oppose the compromises made to reduce its height (the Windsor Framework), and their primary goal is to dismantle the wall entirely to fully reconnect the two halves of the room (Northern Ireland and Great Britain).",
          "entire manifesto": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Manifesto for the 2024 General Election, titled Making NI Work, sets out ten core policy commitments aimed at ensuring Northern Ireland can thrive as a secure and vibrant part of the United Kingdom. The DUP states that these commitments are focused on building on the party’s record of delivery in Westminster and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Summary of Main Policy Commitments: 1. Promoting the Union and Removing Barriers Within the United Kingdom The DUP will continue to fight to fully restore Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom, specifically by working toward removing the application of EU law in the country and the internal Irish Sea border that it creates. They will argue the case for the full primacy of the UK internal market and reject the undermining of its integrity. Furthermore, the party is committed to securing a long-term demonstration from future UK Governments of their commitment to promoting and developing British culture, heritage and traditions in Northern Ireland. The DUP also plans to use the Stormont Brake mechanism and will not hesitate to vote against the continued application of current arrangements in October. 2. Putting You First - Delivering Fair and Equitable Funding for Our NHS, and Other Public Services The DUP campaigns for a new needs-based funding model for Northern Ireland, arguing that chronic underfunding has systematically damaged public services. They will press the next Government to ensure that funding cannot drop below the definition of assessed need, which they define as £124 for every £100 spent in England. Key health policies include: • Driving down waiting lists by fostering partnerships between health and social care in NI and national independent providers. • Providing fellowships for young GPs and establishing a permanent state-backed scheme for indemnity for GPs. • Firmly opposing efforts to legalise assisted suicide. • Campaigning for recurrent funding to provide decent pay awards for public sector staff like nurses, doctors, and teachers. 3. Campaigning to Protect Family Incomes The party seeks to protect incomes, ensure fair taxation, and lift more people out of poverty. Key proposals include: • Opposing the freeze on the personal tax allowance and seeking further reductions in national insurance. • Seeking to abolish VAT on domestic electricity bills and maintaining the freeze on fuel duty. • Maintaining the Triple Lock on state pensions and opposing any further rise in the state pension age. • Supporting measures to ease the burden on families, such as scrapping VAT on school uniforms and removing the two-child limit on Universal Credit for 3- and 4-child households. • Campaigning to reverse the scrapping of free BBC licence fees for over 75s and seeking the eventual abolition of the BBC licence fee in favour of a subscription-based service. 4. Unleashing our Full Economic Potential The DUP is committed to growing the Northern Ireland economy and creating better jobs. Economic policies include: • Increasing the VAT threshold for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) to £100,000 and uprating it in line with inflation. • Exploring the potential introduction of an online sales tax targeting online corporates and marketplaces. • Advocating for a reduction in corporate tax across the United Kingdom, noting that the minimum 15% rate in the Republic of Ireland places NI firms at a competitive disadvantage. • Seeking to prioritize Northern Ireland’s advanced manufacturing and engineering sectors, and maximizing economic opportunities associated with hydrogen technology. 5. A Strategic Role for UK Defence and Security The DUP believes the UK should commit to spending 3.0% of GDP on defence by 2035. They will pursue the greater integration of Northern Ireland into national defence structures, networks, and operations. • They will work to increase the number of major Ministry of Defence (MoD) contracts placed in Northern Ireland and address historically low levels of MoD expenditure in the region. • Regarding Immigration, they will fight to ensure national policy applies equally across the United Kingdom and that Northern Ireland is fully protected in law against illegal immigration. • They advocate for an uplift in funding provided by the Government for Northern Ireland’s Additional Security needs to counter the enduring threat posed by dissident republicans. 6. Backing our Farmers and Food Security The DUP seeks an increased, ring-fenced, and multi-annual farm support and development budget that is inflated to match the impact of inflation since 2020. • They believe food production should be recognized as a strategic national asset and that the needs of farmers cannot be sacrificed for other policy objectives. • They support a commitment by the Government to source 50% of food into the public sector from British farms. • They will support robust Bovine TB eradication policies, including targeted badger culling, with the aim of moving to a vaccination-only approach as soon as possible. 7. Leading a Fairer - Not Faster - Path Towards Net-Zero While supporting the UK’s long-term net-zero ambitions, the DUP is concerned that recent legislation has been rushed and conflicts with scientific advice. They will press for a truly fair transition that is inclusive and addresses the threat of increased costs for basic goods and services. • They support pushing back the ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles to at least 2035 and seek a further review due to high upfront costs and the lack of EV charging infrastructure. • They commit to a concerted effort to tackle the pollution sources contributing to the ecological crisis in Lough Neagh and other waterways, supporting a multi-agency response. 8. Defending Our Most Vulnerable The DUP maintains an unashamedly pro-life stance, opposing the commissioning of, and funding for, abortion services in Northern Ireland. They will seek a review of legislation that they feel criminalizes prayer, including silent prayer, and oppose the application of regulations related to abortion in the Relationships and Sexuality Education curriculum. They also commit to ensuring that people with disabilities have better access to and provision of vital services. 9. Investing More in National Infrastructure The DUP will pursue the full implementation of the Union Connectivity Review. • They secured commitments to improve journeys on the A75 between Gretna and Stranraer and boost port connections between NI and GB. • They advocate for the abolition of domestic air passenger duty to boost competitiveness. • They will work to accelerate the roll-out of 5G coverage and build on their success in securing full-fibre broadband across Northern Ireland. 10. Standing Up for Victims of Crime The DUP will support efforts to repeal the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 (which offers an amnesty in all but name) and urge UK Ministers to repeal this legislation within the first 100 days of the next Parliament. They prioritize a victim-centred approach to investigating the past and guarantee continued funding for the Troubles victims’ pension. • They will campaign to end the \"Wild West\" of social media, supporting robust regulation under the Online Safety Act and seeking a statutory definition of grooming. • They will press for stronger custodial sentences for murder and terror offences in Northern Ireland, bringing NI in line with other regions of the UK."

          "crime": "Sinn Féin’s policies on crime, policing, and justice are detailed primarily in the section titled \"Policing and Justice\" under \"Protecting and Investing in Communities\". The manifesto asserts that the legacy of recent governments has resulted in a crisis of recruitment and morale within An Garda Síochána, lengthy court delays, and prison overcrowding, leading to public order issues and communities feeling unsafe. Sinn Féin’s approach aims to ensure proper resourcing and planning across the entire Justice portfolio to restore public safety through evidence-based policies, harm reduction, and shared responsibility for combating the causes of crime across government. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s key policies on crime and justice: Policing and Public Safety Sinn Féin plans to address the crisis in Garda recruitment and retention and increase the visibility of policing. • Garda Recruitment Drive: Commence the largest Garda recruitment drive in the history of the state, aiming to recruit between 900 and 1,000 Gardaí each year, rising to 1,500 annually once a second college is operational. The goal is an eventual force of 16,000-strong. • Training Capacity: Establish a second Garda Training College with an annual intake capacity of 500 recruits to increase the number of officers. • Retention Measures: Introduce retention measures, including increasing the Garda trainee allowance to €397 per week. They would also establish a Garda Recruitment and Retention Taskforce to investigate the underlying reasons for the crisis. • Rural Crime: Address rural crime by increasing Garda numbers in rural areas. • Community Policing: Support restorative justice efforts to respond to crime in communities. They also plan to legislate to reform Joint Policing Committees (JCPs) to grant them greater powers, functions, and resources to address rural policing priorities. • Community CCTV: Introduce legislation concerning Community CCTV schemes to clarify responsibility for administration and data management. Combating Financial Fraud and Scams The manifesto addresses the alarming increase in financial fraud and scams, noting that inaction has left citizens vulnerable. • Strategy and Taskforce: Establish a multi-annual strategy and taskforce to tackle financial fraud and scams. • Shared Fraud Database: Introduce legislation to establish a Shared Fraud Database to enable banks and An Garda Síochána to share real-time information for detecting fraud and protecting consumers. • Holding Platforms Accountable: Hold online platforms and social media companies accountable for hosting fraudulent adverts by classifying such content as harmful online material and imposing financial penalties against platforms that knowingly fail to remove it. • Bank Accountability: Require banks to introduce a name-checking system to prevent fraudsters from receiving money under false identities, and mandate banks to compensate victims of fraud where this required action fails. • Regulatory Powers: Empower the Communications Regulator to prevent fraudsters from abusing mobile and telephone networks. Justice System and Rehabilitation Sinn Féin views public safety as a \"whole of government responsibility\" and plans to significantly invest in the justice system. • Youth Diversion: Increase new Youth Diversion Projects and expand their age eligibility. • Restorative Justice: Double investment in Restorative Justice Programmes and implement Sinn Féin’s Criminal Justice (Promotion of Restorative Justice) (Amendment) Bill 2023. • Funding: Increase funding for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), the Courts Service, and for Legal Aid. Funding would also be increased for the prison service. • Historic Injustice: Commit to addressing historic injustices, including issuing a state apology to the family of Captain James Kelly, and establishing judicial inquiries into cases like Shane O’Farrell, Sallins, and Terence Wheelock. Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (DSGBV) The manifesto refers to violence against women as an \"epidemic\" requiring urgent action and a zero-tolerance approach. • Rape Crisis Centres: Ensure a Dedicated Rape Crisis Centre (including SATU, helpline, court accompaniment, and counselling services) is available for every 200,000 of the population. • Flee Fund: Establish a Statutory Flee Fund with grants ranging from €500 to €2,500 to assist victims in leaving abusive situations and setting up new homes. • Legal and Medical Support: Raise the disposable income threshold for legal aid in Domestic Violence cases and ensure every Domestic Violence Service that provides accommodation has access to a medical card for clients staying there. • Shelters: Provide €75 million in Capital funding beyond pre-committed amounts for domestic violence shelters. Hate Crime Legislation Sinn Féin explicitly states its opposition to the current government’s approach to hate crime legislation. • Repeal of Act: Sinn Féin would repeal the Criminal Justice (Hate Offences) Act. • Freedom of Speech: They believe the government’s legislation sought to undermine the right to free speech and protest and was not legally sound. Sinn Féin voted against the bill, arguing that vulnerable groups must be protected, but not through measures that could lead to censorship. Analogy for Understanding Sinn Féin’s policy on crime is analogous to approaching a leaking public pool by not only patching the leaks (crimefighting and rehabilitation) but also increasing the flow of water (recruitment/resources) and installing a better filtration system (anti-fraud taskforces) to make the whole environment safer and more functional.",
          "healthcare": "Sinn Féin’s healthcare policies, outlined in the section titled \"Health Sláinte\" and detailed in their standalone plan, A Prescription for Change, focus on \"Taking Big Bold Steps towards Universal Healthcare\" and transforming the health service to improve access, reduce waiting lists, and tackle crises like emergency department overcrowding. The plan is described as ambitious, realistic, practical, and deliverable, developed in close consultation with healthcare workers, patients, and other key stakeholders. Sinn Féin aims to transition towards a publicly funded healthcare system for Ireland by 2035, recognizing physical and mental health as a human right. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s five key priorities in Health and Social Care: 1. Taking Big Bold Steps towards Universal Healthcare Sinn Féin plans to immediately introduce measures to reduce the cost of healthcare for households. • Free Medicines and Cards: Deliver free prescription medicines for all households. • Medical Card Expansion: Upgrade every GP visit card to a full medical card, and provide full medical card cover to all workers up to the median income. • Cost Abolition: Abolish prescription charges for medical card holders and abolish prescription and car-parking charges. • Commitment to Universal Care: Enact \"Healthcare for All\" legislation within the first 100 days to commit the state to achieving full public health cover by 2035. 2. Upgrading and Expanding Local Health Services The party commits to realizing the Sláintecare goal of delivering the right care in the right place at the right time, focusing on primary and community care. • GP and Dental Services: Develop a landmark public GP contract, employ 250 public GPs, and hire public dentists and dental care teams. They would also increase GP training capacity by 60% and dental training places by 32%. • Pharmacy First Model: Implement a \"Pharmacy First\" model for common conditions, expanding the role of pharmacists in primary care. • Home Care: Pursue a \"home first\" approach to care, prioritizing the public delivery of five million additional home care hours through a modern home care scheme. They plan to ensure access to GP services and dental services for communities. 3. Driving Major Reform of Hospital Care Sinn Féin plans to tackle the hospital crisis by significantly increasing bed capacity and investment. • Bed Targets: Deliver 5,000 new hospital beds by 2031. This includes 4,000 additional acute beds and replacing 1,000 existing unsafe beds. • Overcrowding: Implement a zero-tolerance approach to hospital trolleys and overcrowding. • Elective Hospitals: Accelerate the delivery of public-only elective hospitals. The plan includes estimates for four new elective-only public hospitals and regional surgical centers to tackle waiting lists. • Community Beds: Deliver 2,000 community beds, including short and long-stay residential care, nursing, and rehabilitation beds. • Capital Funding: Utilize €2 billion from the Apple Tax money for immediate funding certainty for the 5,000 acute hospital beds. The total health capital investment program would be €15 billion over the next term of government. 4. Revolutionising Youth Mental Health The manifesto singles out mental health, particularly for young people, as an area requiring transformation. • New Service: Establish a new Child and Youth Mental Health Service to replace CAMHS. • Early Intervention: The new service would provide integrated early intervention services for children and young people up to the age of 25. • Counselling and Teams: Expand access to Jigsaw, primary care mental health services, deliver universal counselling, and deliver twenty more early intervention in psychosis teams. 5. Delivering a Rights-Based Approach to Disability Services Sinn Féin commits to a decade-long investment to ensure rights are delivered for disabled people. • Investment: Implement a 10-year investment programme for disability services, with €829 million in additional current expenditure and €659 million additional capital allocated for the first five years. • Personal Assistance (PA) Hours: Commit to doubling the number of Personal Assistance hours over a term of government, and providing an additional 1.5 million disability home care hours. • Residential Care: Provide over 3,000 additional appropriate residential places and deliver on de-congregation commitments. • Assessment and Review: Develop a common, compliant, and efficient process for assessment of need under the Disability Act. They would also conduct an evidence-based, independent review of the service delivery model for Children’s Disability Services (CDNTs) and fully staff the teams. Workforce Planning and Accountability The plan requires significant staffing increases and financial reform. • Recruitment: Plan to recruit 40,000 healthcare and social care workers over five years. This involves giving a job guarantee to Irish health graduates, doubling CAO entry places for medicine and health courses, and attracting Irish workers home. • Efficiency and Savings: Propose a total package of new measures valued at €5.4 billion, partially funded by a minimum target of €1 billion in savings and efficiencies across the health service by 2030, including major reductions in reliance on expensive agency workers and management consultants.",
          "housing": "Sinn Féin’s housing strategy, titled A Home Of Your Own, is a core component of their General Election Manifesto 2024, emphasizing the delivery of affordable and social housing on an unprecedented scale. The party contends that the housing crisis is a result of years of inadequate policy and that affordable housing is key to solving broader issues, including recruitment crises in public services. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s key policies on housing: 1. Housing Supply and Targets Sinn Féin plans to launch the largest social and affordable building program in the history of the state. • Overall Targets: The party would deliver 300,000 new homes between 2025 and 2029 to keep pace with projected future need and address the existing shortage. They also intend to continue delivery into 2030, bringing the six-year total to 370,000 homes. • Public Housing Programme: This massive target includes 125,000 public homes over the five-year period (2025-2029), consisting of: ◦ 75,000 social housing units for those on waiting lists or in insecure private rental accommodation. ◦ 25,000 affordable rental homes for people saving for deposits or currently paying high private rents. ◦ 25,000 affordable purchase homes for people currently locked out of homeownership. • Private Market Targets: The plan also includes 115,000 private market homes for working people to buy, and 60,000 homes for private rent and self-build, ensuring a well-balanced market. 2. Affordability and Accessibility A central goal is making homeownership and renting affordable for ordinary workers and families. • Affordable Prices: Affordable homes for purchase would start from €250,000. • Affordable Rent: Affordable rental homes would be priced at an average of €1,000 per month or lower. • Rent Freeze: To protect renters immediately, Sinn Féin would implement a ban on rent increases for three years, providing certainty while affordable homes are built. • Renter Support: They would provide a refundable tax credit equivalent to one month’s rent back in renters’ pockets, with a minimum payment of €1,000 for each adult renter. 3. Reform and Delivery Mechanisms Sinn Féin’s plan details how they intend to fund and accelerate the delivery of this building programme. • Funding: Delivering 125,000 public homes over five years is estimated to cost an average of €7.4 billion per year, financed through a combination of exchequer funding, Housing Finance Agency borrowing, and other lenders. • Apple Tax Allocation: Sinn Féin commits to using €7.6 billion of the Apple Tax money specifically towards their public housing programme. • Constitutional Right: They would hold a referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution. • Land Management: The current Land Development Agency (LDA) would be transformed into an Active Land Management Agency to secure an adequate pipeline of land for public housing. • Streamlining Processes: They would reform and resource the planning system, overhaul the public spending code, and streamline procurement by using multi-annual framework agreements instead of single project tendering to speed up delivery and provide certainty to builders. • Vacant/Derelict Homes: Maximizing the use of new building technologies and vacant and derelict properties is a priority, as these methods are faster and more sustainable. • Ending Wasteful Schemes: Sinn Féin would eliminate \"wasteful and inflationary schemes\" such as Croí Conaithe Cities, the First Home Scheme, and the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund. The Help to Buy Scheme would be phased out over five years. • Builder Support: They would support small- and medium-sized builders by providing low-cost finance, efficient site servicing, and timely planning. 4. Water and Defects Addressing underlying infrastructure and building defects is included in the housing plan. • Public Water Ownership: A referendum would be held to enshrine the public ownership of the water and wastewater system and utility in the Constitution. • Water Investment: Investment in water and wastewater services would be increased by at least an additional €1.5 billion over five years to meet the needs of the housing plan. • Building Defects Redress: Sinn Féin would ensure 100% redress for all homeowners impacted by building defects and defective materials through an end-to-end scheme. They would allocate €1 billion of the Apple Tax money to supplement existing capital available for defects redress.",
          "immigration": "Sinn Féin’s policies on immigration are centered on managing migration effectively, ensuring fairness, and safeguarding social cohesion through the establishment of a dedicated agency and changes to current accommodation practices. Their approach is guided by principles of equality, justice, sovereignty, and anti-racism. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s key policies on immigration and international protection: 1. Establishment of an Immigration Management Agency (IMA) The core proposal is to create a single, centralized body to address the current fragmented and under-resourced system. • Creation of the Agency: Sinn Féin would set up a new Immigration Management Agency under the Department of Justice and Home Affairs. This is proposed at an additional cost of €5.5 million. • Centralized Responsibility: The IMA would assume responsibility for several functions currently spread across multiple departments and bodies, including: ◦ Processing of International Protection (IP) applicants in a fair and efficient manner. ◦ Enforcement of rules, including the investigation of illegal immigration and the enforcement of deportation orders. ◦ Registration of individuals. ◦ Accommodation for IP applicants. ◦ Proper planning of the migration system. • Resourcing: The new agency would be properly resourced, with plans to treble staffing across the system at a cost of €82 million to ensure fast and fair decisions are made. • Border Management: The party believes that every state must be able to control its borders and that robust bi-lateral arrangements with Britain are necessary to manage immigration while protecting the free movement of citizens across the land border. This includes agreeing on arrangements with Britain for managing immigration at airports and ports to ensure IP applicants who should be processed in Britain are returned there. 2. Accommodation and Community Engagement Sinn Féin addresses the chaos and lack of public confidence resulting from the current government’s mismanagement of international protection accommodation. • Location Criteria: New International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) centers would be managed based on criteria such as the availability of services and levels of economic and social disadvantage. This means that new centers would only be placed in more affluent areas that have the existing capacity and services to support them, protecting working-class communities already under severe pressure. • Accommodation Model: They propose transitioning the IP accommodation system to greater use of purpose-built, state-owned beds, while reducing reliance on profit-driven commercial providers often criticized for poor quality and unsuitable locations. • Consultation and Oversight: A standard, transparent, and consistent approach to community consultation would be created, including opportunities for submissions. They would also invite the Children’s Ombudsman and HIQA to periodically report on the standards of all International Protection accommodation. • Ending Two-Tier System: The party would end the two-tier system to ensure all those seeking international protection are treated equally, irrespective of where they come from. 3. Measures Related to Residence and Enforcement • Registration Requirements: Sinn Féin would examine the registration requirements and models in operation in other EU countries regarding EU, EEA, and Swiss citizens to enable authorities to be more fully aware of population movements for service planning and law enforcement purposes. • Enforcement: They plan for greater implementation of legal provisions for fines on airlines and other carriers transporting passengers with no documents, and for prosecutions of individuals. 4. Temporary Protection Directive (Ukrainian Refugees) Sinn Féin views the continuous extension of temporary measures as unsustainable and problematic. • Orderly Conclusion: The special status of Ukrainians under the Temporary Protection Directive should come to an end no later than March 2026. • Transition to Permanent Rules: After this period, they advocate for a return to ordinary, permanent immigration rules. • Assisted Return: If a beneficiary is from a safe part of Ukraine, assisted return should be provided, save for exceptional cases. Those from unsafe areas can apply for International Protection, and others wishing to stay can apply for work-based permits. • Ending Payment Scheme: Sinn Féin would end the Accommodation Recognition Payment scheme for Ukrainian beneficiaries so that new applicants cannot join, arguing that the current scheme disadvantages other families seeking to rent private accommodation. Sinn Féin’s overall goal is to achieve a system that works well and quickly, applying rules fairly, treating people with dignity, and ensuring local communities are respected.",
          "defence": "Sinn Féin’s policies on defense are primarily focused on protecting Irish neutrality, resisting further militarization within the European Union, and urgently investing in and reforming the Defence Forces to address crises in recruitment, retention, and equipment deficits. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s key defense policies: 1. Protecting and Upholding Neutrality Sinn Féin views military neutrality as having served Ireland well and commits to its protection. • Triple-Lock Protection: Sinn Féin would maintain the triple-lock neutrality protection. The party notes that proposals to abandon this mechanism breach commitments previously given to the Irish people. • Constitutional Referendum: They would bring forward a referendum to enshrine military neutrality and non-alignment in the Irish constitution. If successful, they would then engage with EU institutions to recognize the integrity of neutral states in the EU treaties. • Opposition to Militarization: Sinn Féin opposes any attempts to transfer decision-making powers on Foreign Affairs and Defence to the European Union, including opposing Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) on such matters, and opposes any prospects for the formation of an EU army. • Deployment Policy: While maintaining neutrality, Sinn Féin would prioritize participation in UN peacekeeping missions. They would seek to reverse the government’s decision to withdraw from the United Nations Disengagement Observe Force (UNDOF) mission to the Golan Heights. • Oireachtas Oversight: They commit to ensuring comprehensive Oireachtas oversight and scrutiny of all proposals for Irish participation in international military missions and exercises. 2. Investing in the Defence Forces The manifesto highlights that the Defence Forces are at a \"critical juncture\" due to years of underfunding, issues with pay and conditions, and a severe recruitment and retention crisis. • Increased Numbers: Sinn Féin plans to increase Defence Force member numbers to rebuild the force to a baseline figure of 11,500 members, which is the Level of Ambition (LOA) 2 requirement. As of August 2024, the strength stood at 7,426. • Capital Investment: They propose providing an additional €295 million in capital expenditure by 2030 to meet the LOA 2 capital spending targets by 2032. • Key Equipment: They would prioritize the acquisition of primary radar and subsea capabilities. • Funding Commitment: Sinn Féin proposes increasing annual current funding for the Defence Forces by €206.9 million over and above existing pre-committed funding. • Working Time Directive: They commit to improving conditions of members through the urgent implementation of the Working Time Directive. • Support for Members: They would allocate funding to healthcare and medical supports for those whose health was unduly negatively impacted through their service (referencing issues raised by the Women of Honour). They would also increase funding for Veterans Associations. The party maintains that strong, adequately equipped Defence Forces are necessary to uphold Ireland’s status as a neutral state and to carry out duties, including assistance in civil duties such as dealing with natural disasters.",
          "economy": "Sinn Féin’s economic policies, framed under the section \"Economic and Regional Development\" and detailed in \"Funding Change,\" propose a fundamental shift toward increased public investment, prioritizing domestic growth, and ensuring a fairer distribution of wealth and resources, often contrasting their approach with the \"failures\" of previous governments. The overall strategy is built upon four principles for public spending: increased investment in public services; a fair tax system benefiting low and middle-income workers; reducing national debt as a proportion of the economy; and investing a portion of windfall corporate tax revenues in housing and infrastructure. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s key economic policies and strategies: 1. Funding Strategy and Public Finances Sinn Féin proposes a substantial increase in public expenditure, funded primarily through leveraging windfall corporate tax receipts and increasing taxes on high earners and wealth. • Increased Investment: Provide an additional €14.3 billion in current spending and €41.8 billion in capital investment over and above pre-committed expenditure for existing services, demographics, and the National Development Plan (NDP). • Capital Investment Target: Increase average capital investment to 6% of GNI* over the period 2025–2030 to address infrastructure deficits, up from the current government’s failure to meet the 5% target. • Budgetary Surplus: Commit to running a budgetary surplus every year, targeting an accumulated surplus of €14.8 billion by 2030, with surpluses invested in state funds to maintain strong public finances and reduce debt. • Apple Tax Allocation: Utilize the €14.1 billion Apple Tax money for targeted capital investment in critical areas, including: ◦ €7.6 billion for the public housing programme. ◦ €2.5 billion to establish a new Renewable Energy Fund to invest in the energy grid and facilitate renewable energy. ◦ €2 billion for immediate funding certainty for the delivery of 5,000 acute hospital beds. ◦ €1 billion for a new Community Investment Fund to invest in working-class communities. ◦ €1 billion to supplement capital available for defective building materials redress, ensuring a guaranteed tripling of funding. 2. Taxation Strategy and Cost of Living Relief Sinn Féin’s tax strategy aims to benefit low- and middle-income earners while increasing contributions from those with higher incomes and wealth. • Abolish USC: Abolish the Universal Social Charge (USC) on the first €45,000 of every worker’s income, resulting in over €1,100 extra a year for average workers, and ensuring the average worker pays no USC. • Solidarity Tax: Introduce a 3% solidarity tax on individual incomes above €140,000 and reform tax credits for individual incomes above €100,000. • Local Property Tax (LPT): Abolish the Local Property Tax and replace it with direct funding for Local Authorities. • Carbon Tax and Excise: Stop all planned increases to the carbon tax from 2025–2030, and reverse the two most recent hikes to excise duty on petrol and diesel for 12 months. • Wealth and Housing Taxes: Establish a Wealth Tax Commission to advise on implementing a net wealth tax. Increase stamp duty to end the bulk purchasing of residential property by institutional investors, and abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers on properties up to €450,000. • Corporate Tax: Maintain the corporation tax rate at 12.5% and defend Ireland’s tax sovereignty. They would restrict corporation tax relief for the banking sector and increase the banking levy to €400 million. 3. Enterprise, Employment, and Regional Development The economic policy focuses on rebalancing the economy away from excessive reliance on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) toward a stronger, indigenous industrial base rooted across all regions of Ireland. • FDI Focus: Continue to attract FDI, but direct investment into key knowledge-intensive sectors (e.g., cleantech/renewables and artificial intelligence) and ensure it is distributed across the country to alleviate pressure on Dublin. • Domestic Enterprise: Establish \"Mol Gnó\", a new Irish Enterprise Agency, with an annual budget of almost €10 million, focused on scaling existing Irish businesses and supporting non-export-focused start-ups and established companies. • Regional Rebalancing: Invest substantially in infrastructure to eliminate deficits throughout the country, supporting the development of regions outside urban centers. • VAT Reduction: Introduce a reduced 9% rate of VAT for parts of the Hospitality sector (excluding accommodation), costing €605 million. • Workers’ Rights: Strengthen workers’ rights, legislating for the Right to Organise and a legal right to collective bargaining. Increase the minimum wage by €1.10 per hour in 2025 to move towards the Living Wage. • Community Business Models: Allocate funding to support the expansion of the workers’ co-operative model (€2m/year) and the Community Wealth Building Fund (€1m/year) to develop community-driven businesses and recirculate wealth locally. 4. Infrastructure and Transport Investment Sinn Féin aims to significantly improve infrastructure delivery by increasing investment and reforming oversight. • Capital Project Oversight: Develop increased expertise in the Department of Public Expenditure under the National Investment Office to avoid delays and overruns on large capital projects, giving the office a clear oversight and assurance role. • PPP Contracts: Move away from the use of controversial Public Private Partnerships (PPP) contracts for public infrastructure. • Transport Infrastructure: Prioritize the progression of major transport projects, including the Western Rail Corridor (WRC) to Collooney, the Navan rail line reopening, and the Metrolink project in Dublin. Increase funding for public transport (by €126 million annually) and allocate €102 million capital funding to make all public transport wheelchair accessible. Economic Metaphor Sinn Féin’s economic plan is like remodeling a national house: instead of just patching up the leaky roof (windfall taxes) for temporary comfort, they plan to build new, affordable wings (300,000 homes), install efficient, public-owned utilities (energy independence), and ensure everyone contributes fairly to the construction costs (tax reforms on wealth and high income), ultimately making the entire structure sound and accessible to all families, rather than just the wealthiest investors.",
          "education": "Sinn Féin’s education policies are aimed at making education truly free and inclusive, covering all levels from primary school up to further and higher education, with a strong emphasis on addressing costs, special educational needs, and staffing shortages. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s key policies on education: 1. Reducing the Cost of Education A central commitment is to ensure education is free and affordable, tackling the significant financial burden on parents. • Phasing Out Student Fees: They plan to completely phase out third level student fees (the contribution charge) within three years, starting by halving them in 2025. • Voluntary Contributions: They will end schools’ reliance on \"voluntary contributions\" by increasing annual core capitation funding and the ancillary services grant to schools by €150 million and legislating to end the contributions. • School Meals and Books: ◦ Expand the hot school meals scheme to all primary schools and commence rollout to secondary schools. ◦ Extend the free schoolbooks scheme to senior cycle in secondary schools from September 2025 and increase the School Book Grant for primary school children from €80 to €110. • Uniforms and Devices: Introduce measures via an Affordable School Uniform Bill to ensure schools make uniforms affordable, and introduce a scheme to alleviate the cost of digital devices starting with DEIS secondary schools. • Grants and Supports: Increase SUSI grants by 15% (adjacent and non-adjacent) and expand the availability of SUSI for qualifying Postgraduate students. 2. Prioritizing Special Educational Needs (SEN) Sinn Féin aims to address the challenges faced by children with SEN, moving away from crisis-response toward adequate planning and rights implementation. • Legislation and Rights: They would enact a new rights-based Education Bill and provide the resources to implement it. They would also require the Department of Education’s Inspectorate to report on the implementation of Individual Education Plans (IEPs). • Planning and Appeals: Provide the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) with greater powers to ensure sufficient and appropriate school places and classes are provided, and establish robust appeals mechanisms for resource allocation decisions. • Staffing: Provide funding for the recruitment of 1,000 additional Special Education Teachers and 1,300 additional Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) on average per annum. • Psychologists: Recruit additional educational psychologists and provide greater administrative support to make better use of their time. • Summer Programmes: Commit to improving and reversing cuts to the Summer Programme to alleviate parents’ stress and prevent regression for children with SEN. 3. Tackling Educational Disadvantage and Staffing Shortages Policies focus on redirecting resources and addressing recruitment and retention issues among teaching staff. • Private School Subsidies: Phase out the state subsidy to private fee-paying schools over the term of government (saving €131 million annually) and redirect that funding into public schools. • DEIS+ Scheme: Introduce a DEIS+ scheme to target additional resources at the DEIS schools with the greatest level of need. • Guidance Counsellors: Increase the number of guidance counsellors by 10%. • Teacher Recruitment/Retention: Address staffing shortages by ensuring full-time, permanent posts are more quickly available to teachers and reviewing teacher contracts. They would also award full incremental credit for experience teaching abroad in equivalent jurisdictions. • PME Review: Undertake a comprehensive review of the Professional Master of Education (PME) course structure, which is often cited as a major cost and duration barrier. 4. Further and Higher Education (Excluding Costs) Sinn Féin addresses issues related to funding, employment, and accommodation in the third level sector. • Core Funding: Aim to close the core funding gap in the Higher Education sector and ensure the National Training Fund (NTF) fulfills its purpose. • Precarious Employment: Remove the Employment Control Framework to allow universities greater flexibility to determine staffing and commit to ending precarious employment and the use of short-term insecure contracts. • Student Accommodation: Allocate €300 million capital expenditure to fast-track purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) projects where planning has been granted. They would also amend regulations to move away from overly high-spec requirements (like mandatory en suite bathrooms) toward more communal and cost-effective designs. They would also progress legislation to provide greater protections for students in \"digs\" (Rent-a-Room scheme). • Apprenticeships: Abolish fees for apprentices and increase the rates of allowances for craft apprentices by 50%. They would also introduce a special allowance (€10,000) for craft apprenticeship instructors. 5. School Transport The party plans significant reform and expansion of the school transport system. • Expansion Targets: Reform and expand the system to provide an additional 100,000 pupils with transport services by 2030. • Eligibility Criteria: Reduce the distance criteria to 1km for primary and 2km for secondary school pupils, and facilitate routes to schools other than the nearest one where demand exists. 6. Irish Language in Education Sinn Féin seeks a culture shift to promote the Irish language and increase access to Irish-medium education. • Policy Focus: Develop and implement an evidence-based state policy rooted in the principle of not only meeting but actively growing demand for Irish-medium schooling and treating access to it as a right. • Gaelscoil Targets: Set progressively increasing targets for attendance, aiming to double provision at primary level within a decade and work toward delivering a Gaelcholáiste in every county. • Teaching Reform: Increase focus on spoken Irish at Junior Cert by introducing an oral exam worth at least 40% of the overall mark. They would also replace the current framework for Irish exemptions with a new inclusive approach tailored to student needs. • Third Level: Double Irish Medium Education funding at the third level and increase the range and uptake of Irish medium courses. Sinn Féin’s approach to education, particularly its proposal to eliminate student fees and end voluntary school contributions, mirrors a belief that public services should be fully accessible and publicly funded, reducing barriers to participation for young people, akin to treating education as a foundational public utility that the state must fully subsidize, similar to water infrastructure.",
          "environment": "Sinn Féin’s environmental, climate, and energy policies are outlined under the heading \"Environment, Climate and Energy,\" emphasizing a shift \"From Eco-Austerity to Climate Justice\". The party aims to accelerate the green transition, achieve energy independence, and tackle the biodiversity crisis, while ensuring the transition is fair and does not disproportionately burden low- and middle-income households. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s key policies on the environment, climate, and energy: 1. Accelerating the Green Transition and Energy Independence Sinn Féin plans significant public investment to transform Ireland’s reliance on imported fossil fuels to energy independence through renewables. • Renewable Energy Investment Fund: Establish a new €2.5 billion Renewable Energy Investment Fund using part of the Apple Tax money. This fund would be used to substantially increase investment in the energy grid to facilitate renewable energy potential. • Grid Constraints: Increase investment in grid expansion and upgrades to connect existing and new renewable projects. • Public Ownership: Expand the role of state ownership in the renewable energy system by enabling the state to take equity investments in joint-venture projects using the Renewable Energy Investment Scheme. This is intended to reorient the market away from excessive private profiteering. • Offshore Wind Infrastructure: Invest in strategic port development to facilitate the construction and maintenance of offshore wind farms at scale, recognizing that currently, only Belfast Port has this capacity. They would provide at least €80 million from the Renewable Energy Investment Fund to kickstart this investment. • Planning Reform: Review workforce planning and increase resourcing for state bodies involved in environmental planning (e.g., MARA, ABP) to address the slow, adversarial planning system that delays renewables projects. 2. Retrofitting and Affordability The party commits to overhauling the national retrofit program to make it accessible for ordinary households and tackle energy poverty. • Tiered Grants: Radically reform how retrofitting is funded, targeted, and delivered by establishing a new tiered grants-based retrofit scheme. • Targeting Funding: Direct 75% of the funding to those on low and modest incomes. • Investment: Invest €7 billion to expand retrofitting. This includes €1.5 billion in capital investment for the deep retrofit of over 100,000 homes and €850 million for the deep retrofit of over 44,000 social homes. • Solid Fuel Homes: Establish a dedicated scheme, with €750 million capital investment, for the retrofitting of solid fuel homes. 3. Climate Justice and Taxation Sinn Féin advocates for a climate justice approach, rejecting \"eco-austerity\" and focusing on the greatest emitters. • Carbon Tax and Excise Duties: They would not proceed with the annual increases to the carbon tax scheduled from 2025–2030. They would also reverse the two most recent hikes to excise duty on petrol and diesel for 12 months. • Pollution Tax: Target environmental taxes on excessive consumption, specifically introducing a pollution tax on private jets. • PSO Levy Reform: Reform the PSO levy (which subsidizes renewables and is charged to consumers) to make it a progressive charge levied on total energy demand rather than peak demand, to shift the burden away from households. 4. Biodiversity and Natural Resources The manifesto addresses the crisis in biodiversity, committing to greater funding and restoration efforts. • Nature Restoration Fund: Establish a dedicated €300 million nature restoration fund. This funding would assist farmers in taking action to meet environmental and biodiversity targets. • National Parks: Expansion and restoration of national parks and native woodlands. • Marine Protected Areas (MPA): Expedite the delivery of a Marine Protected Areas Bill. They would involve fishermen and their representatives in co-creating MPA spaces to minimize disruption. • Destructive Practices: Seek a complete ban on huge factory vessels registering and fishing within the EU and waters under the Common Fisheries Policy, citing damage to marine biodiversity. 5. Circular Economy and Waste Management Sinn Féin seeks to overhaul waste management practices, reducing privatization and increasing accountability. • Waste Collection: Bring bin collection back under public control via a franchise model starting with a pilot scheme in Dublin City Council. • Corporate Accountability: Introduce measures to hold corporations accountable, including legislating for large retailers to be compelled to donate unsold food rather than dumping it, and banning the dumping of new and unused goods. • Construction Waste: Establish a task force to minimize construction and demolition waste. Infrastructure Investment The plan includes significant capital investment in areas that mitigate climate change impacts : • Flood Defences: Provide €100 million in additional capital funding to the OPW (Office of Public Works) to improve flood defenses. • Water Services: Increase investment in water and wastewater services by at least an \"additional €1.5 billion over five years\".",
          "brexit": "Sinn Féin’s policy stance regarding the changes stemming from the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (often referred to as Brexit) is intrinsically linked to its goals for Irish reunification and its strategy for managing cross-border relations and the all-island economy. Here is a summary of Sinn Féin’s policies related to post-Brexit challenges and the resulting focus on the island of Ireland: Constitutional Change and Anglo-Irish Relations The party positions the constitutional future of the island as a key objective in government, driven by the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. • Reunification Planning: Sinn Féin would commence planning for and actively working toward holding referendums on Irish reunification by the end of this decade. • Dublin-London Relationship: The party stresses the need for a mature, confident and pragmatic approach to managing constitutional change between Dublin and London. Both the British and Irish governments are acknowledged as having a responsibility to work together as co-guarantors of peace, reconciliation, and the realization of a new future. • Political Strength: Sinn Féin aims to strengthen and enhance the peace process by being in government both North and South. • Political Sentiment: The manifesto highlights recent polling suggesting that the proportion of people in the North supporting the union with Britain is now below 50%. The All-Island Economy and Cooperation Sinn Féin emphasizes leveraging the interconnectedness of the island’s economy to ensure future prosperity. • Maximizing Benefits: They commit to maximizing the benefits of the all-island economy to ensure prosperity and growth, delivering social, environmental, and economic benefits across the island. • North-South Cooperation: They plan to continue the work of the North South Ministerial Council in maximizing benefits for all citizens and, where possible, expand cooperation in areas such as education, health, and the all-island economy. Border Management and Immigration Sinn Féin acknowledges the challenge of maintaining the borderless nature of the island while controlling migration. • Bilateral Arrangements with Britain: They state that robust bi-lateral arrangements with Britain are necessary in order to protect the free movement of citizens across the land border on the island while simultaneously managing immigration. • Immigration Returns: They propose agreeing on revised bilateral arrangements with Britain for managing immigration at airports and ports. This would ensure that International Protection (IP) applicants who should be processed in Britain are returned there. European Engagement Sinn Féin maintains that Ireland’s place is within the European Union. • Advocacy for Unity: They commit to initiating a diplomatic offensive to promote Irish unity through international forums and bodies, including the European Union. They would actively work to ensure that the EU and countries outside the EU economically and actively support Irish reunification. • Sovereignty: They oppose the removal of the Irish veto on matters of Foreign Policy at the European Council and oppose any attempts to transfer decision-making powers on Foreign Affairs and Defence to the European Union, or the removal of unanimity on these matters.",
