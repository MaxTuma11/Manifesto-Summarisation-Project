PRIORITISING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE.
Scotland’s capital budget, which pays for our hospitals, roads and schools, has been hammered by successive Westminster Governments refusing to prioritise investment.
Westminster’s cuts to capital funding have disrupted longer term investment and, as a result, restricted the growth of the Scottish economy.
In the UK Spring Budget, the Tories cut capital yet again, this time by almost 9% – or a cumulative loss of £1.3bn by 2027/28. This cut, coupled with sky high inflation, places unprecedented pressure on our infrastructure budget.
It is vital that the UK Government at least reverse the £1.3bn cut to our capital budget, to enable us to invest in the new hospitals, schools, rail and road infrastructure we would like to see, and help to achieve net zero and secure the sustainable jobs we need for the future.
“We will call on the UK Government to scrap their fiscal rules to allow greater investment in infrastructure and public services.”  Brexit has been a disaster for Scotland. Despite voting overwhelmingly to remain within the EU, we have been dragged out against our will and are powerless to escape the consequences.
Brexit has wiped billions of pounds from the Scottish economy, pushed up prices on food and services and hit hard our ability to fund vital public services such as the NHS.
