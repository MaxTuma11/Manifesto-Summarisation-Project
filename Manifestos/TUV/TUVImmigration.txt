IMMIGRATION.
On 13th May this year in our High Court, there was a judgement of immense constitutional significance. It ruled that the UK Government’s Rwanda Bill could not apply in Northern Ireland.
This was constitutionally significant in that an Act of the sovereign Parliament of the United Kingdom was overruled and set aside because of the supremacy of EU law, which is bestowed by Article 2 of the sovereignty-grabbing Protocol, subjecting Northern Ireland alone in the United Kingdom to its supremacy, its laws and its rights.
The consequence, of course, given the subject, is that Northern Ireland will now become a magnet for illegal migrants, flooding into Northern Ireland to escape the potential consequences that lie within the Rwanda scheme.
Thanks to the pressure from Reform UK, it is probable that the next Government will, whether it likes to or not, be forced to introduce tougher measures to curb immigration. However, for as long as the Sea Border remains Northern Ireland will not be covered by these measures.
Significantly, the DUP's 'Safeguarding the Union' contains a blatant lie in paragraph 46, where it states: "The Windsor Framework applies only in respect of the trade in goods".
TUV told the people that that was not so, and now the High Court equally says that it is not so.
A vote for TUV in this election is a vote for a robust migration policy across the whole of the UK.
We agree with the position of Reform UK in their Manifesto, reproduced below: Uncontrolled mass immigration has pushed the UK to breaking point. Reform UK will secure Britain’s borders to protect wages, our public services, and British culture and values.
• Freeze Non-Essential Immigration.
Strict limits on immigration are the only way to relieve the pressure on our housing, public services, increase wages and protect our culture, identity and values. Essential skills, mainly around healthcare, must be the only exception.
 • Stop the Boats with our 4 Point Plan.
- Leave the European Convention on Human Rights.
- Zero illegal immigrants to be resettled in the UK. New Department of Immigration.
- Pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France.
- Secure Detention for all illegal migrants • Secure Detention for all Asylum Seekers.
All asylum seekers that arrive illegally from safe countries will be processed rapidly, offshore if necessary. Those entering from a safe country will also be barred from claiming asylum or citizenship. No legal aid for non-citizens.
Those rejected will be returned.
• Immediate Deportation for Foreign Criminals.
Deport foreign nationals immediately after their prison sentence ends. With- draw citizenship from immigrants who commit crime with the exception of some misdemeanour offences.
• Bar Student Dependents.
Introduce new visa rules for international students that bar dependents. Only international students with essential skills can remain in the UK. Close down fake courses and immigration schemes that abuse the rules.
• Stop Health Tourism and Immediate Access to Benefits We will impose a requirement of 5 years residency and employment to claim any benefits in the UK.
• Employer Immigration Tax The National Insurance rate will be raised to 20% for foreign workers. This would incentivise businesses to employ British citizens whose National Insurance rate would stay at 13.8%. Essential foreign health and care workers would be exempt from the tax, as would businesses who employ 5 staff members and under. This would boost wages and could raise more than £20 billion over five years to pay for apprenticeships and training for young British people.
