EDUCATION.
The shortage of funding and the imbalance between sectors is hitting the controlled sector particularly hard. TUV wants to address this inequality.
TUV sees tackling educational underachievement as its number one priority, in particular for the Protestant working class.
To do this, we propose the following: • An evidence-informed curriculum overhaul; • Investment in teacher recruitment and fair teacher pay; • Creation of a system in which children can find different paths to successful outcomes; • A commitment to academic selection, but also to creating a more equal system of exceptional Grammar and non-selective schools.
• A creation of a culture of "celebration" for hard work and achievement across all aspects of school life.
• Helping children to see value in education, by ensuring it connects them to a job market which harnesses their skills and talents; • Supporting schools to connect with their communities, parents, and external agencies.
 • Vocational training, for those seeking apprenticeships, commencing at school and moving on to FE with employer support.
• Developing a culture of trust in and respect for the teaching profession, which has been eroded.
TUV believes in a fair deal for classroom assistants including greater job security and holiday pay.
