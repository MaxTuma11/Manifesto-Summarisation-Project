SUITABLE HOUSING FOR ALL.
TUV believes that everyone is entitled to decent housing. The most common request of Housing Executive and Housing Association tenants is for repairs to be carried out in a timely manner. Given the expenditure proposed by others on items which deliver no tangible day to day benefit - such as Casement - we believe that adequate funding can be found for basics like proactive maintenance and addressing issues like mould.
The dereliction of housing in working class areas cannot continue. TUV proposes a policy of one house down and at least one house up in urban areas.
TUV believes that social engineering should play no part in housing policy.
The change wrought by an open border policy with the EU has left a legacy of issues. Where assimilation has not occurred, it is often the indigenous community that feels uncomfortable. TUV will not run away from such issues but will ensure local communities are supported and their rights and interests respected.
 TUV believes that there is an urgent need for reform of the housing points system. For example, the current arrangement whereby homeless points are only awarded 28 days prior to termination of a tenancy agreement does not give people adequate time to secure alternative accommodation.
