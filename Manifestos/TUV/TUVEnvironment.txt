Food production and farming is an integrated £5 billion industry in Northern Ireland. The centrality of our farming and food sector to Northern Ireland’s economy means its future must not be jeopardised by pursuit of an anti-farming ideology associated with climate change activists. The support by Sinn Fein, SDLP, Alliance and the UUP of the Green Party’s Private Member’s Bill was ill-judged and wholly prejudicial to the future of farming. TUV was clear and determined in opposing this disastrous Bill and will continue to protect farming interests.
The devastating situation in Ukraine has brought massive detriment both to world food production and the cost of essential feedstuffs and materials like fertiliser. Hence the utter folly of pursuit of net zero Climate Change demands which will reduce our food production capacity in Northern Ireland.
