THE ECONOMY – PERSONAL.
TUV shares the Reform UK approach to our economy. We quote from their 2024 Manifesto: Reform UK will make work pay and help the unemployed to escape the benefits trap.
• Make Work Pay. Lift the Income Tax Start Point to £20,000 Per Year.
This frees up to 7 million people from paying Income Tax and saves every worker almost £1,500 per year. Basic Tax rate stays at 20%. The higher rate should begin at £70,000.
• Cut Energy Taxes, Beat the Cost-of-Living Crisis Save households over £500 per year. Lower fuel duty by 20p per litre for both residential and business users. Scrap VAT on energy bills. Scrap environmental levies.
• Cut Residential Stamp Duty Substantially boost economic activity and housebuilding by cutting Stamp Duty to 0% below £750k. Cut it to 2% from £750k - £1.5m and cut it to 4% over £1.5m.
• Abolish the VAT Tourist Tax The government has cost our economy over £10 billion when they stopped the VAT refund scheme for tourist shopping. This also deterred up to 2 million tourists.
THE ECONOMY – BUSINESS Reform UK will back risk takers and wealth creators and make sure that Britain is open for business.
• Free Over 1.2 Million Small and Medium Sized Businesses from Corporation Tax Raise the minimum profit threshold to £100k. Reduce the main Corporation Tax Rate from 25% to 20%, then to 15% from Year 3.
 • Abolish IR35 Rules to Support Sole Traders Britain’s self-employed often work longer hours and take more risks. Many have no pension and receive no sick pay.
• Raise the VAT Threshold to £150,000 Free up small entrepreneurs from red tape.
• Support Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Abolish Business Rates for high street based SMEs. Offset this with Online Delivery Tax at 4% for large, multinational enterprises to create a fairer playing field for high streets. Cut entrepreneurs’ tax to 5%.
• Reform the Planning System Fast-track new housing on brownfield sites and infrastructure projects to boost businesses.
• Slash Red Tape to Boost Industry and Exports Scrap thousands of laws that hold back British business and damage productivity.
• Reform the Tax System Major simplification is needed. At over 21,000 pages, the UK’s tax code is a burden. Hong Kong’s tax code is under 500 pages.
 COST OF LIVING CRISIS.
Across the UK the cost of living crisis continues, making life tough for everyone.
Now, more than ever, people demand prudence from government when it comes to spending. They need MPs committed to smaller government knowing that this will keep taxation down. They need MPs who will stand up and oppose politically motivated schemes which seem to have no upper limit when it comes to the cost to the taxpayer, of which Casement Park is a prime example.
Similarly, the iniquitous Protocol is adding to the cost of living in Northern Ireland, adding to paperwork for ordinary businesses, disrupting our supply chain from Great Britain and driving up prices for you, the consumer.
Significantly, because of the Protocol Northern Ireland is tied to EU rules which insist on at least 5% VAT on energy bills.
TUV has proved at council and Assembly level that we are the enemies of squander. Our MPs will bring the same attitude to Westminster.
FAIR FUNDING DEAL FOR NORTHERN IRELAND.
TUV will fight in Westminster for a fair financial funding deal for Northern Ireland.
Whereas self-help must come from cutting out squander and waste, there must be adequate funding for our essential services. Just as in other devolved regions the funding formula has been updated to account for local needs, so Northern Ireland must not be left behind. The profligacy of Stormont must not rob our people of an objectively fair settlement.
