ECONOMY.
We affirm our commitment to supporting City Deals and Growth Deals across the Northern Ireland, including the Belfast Region City Deal, Derry-Londonderry and Strabane Region City Deal, Mid South West Growth Deal, and Causeway Coast and Glens Growth Deal. With a potential investment of £1.3 billion, funded from Westminster and Stormont, these initiatives will foster global centres of innovation excellence. Harnessing the expertise of our universities and businesses will give Northern Ireland unprecedented opportunities for collaboration and drive the development of groundbreaking technologies, products, and services.
Addressing the challenges of a region and an economy still gripped in a cost-of-living crisis, the need is for far sighted leadership in order to achieve more prosperous, sustainable and competitive alternatives. Whilst agriculture is the largest industry in Northern Ireland – we feed around 10 million people across the UK and EU - and with healthy fintech, cybersecurity, aerospace and defence sectors, our neglected industry is tourism and hospitality.
Tourism and hospitality in NI represent around 4 - 5% of our Gross Value Added (GVA) to our economy – that’s roughly £1Bn and it employs around 65,000 directly and indirectly of our people.
With the number of visitors to Northern Ireland in the region of 5.3 million annually, it represents an important industry as well as a window for the world to enjoy our unique attractions, countryside and our welcoming population.
Yet our tourism and hospitality sector face unfair competition from the Republic of Ireland in terms of pricing since the Value Added Tax regime in the RoI is 13.5% - up recently from 12.5% but still a lot more attractive than the 20% VAT rate in NI. The Ulster Unionist Party will work at Westminster to seek commitment to lower Leisure and Hospitality VAT in Northern Ireland to match the Republic of Ireland, allowing our hotels, restaurants and leisure businesses to compete on a level playing field with our closest neighbour.
WE WILL: We will lobby in Parliament to establish a 'Freeport Northern Ireland,' capitalising on UK government policy to establish freeports nationwide. Given Northern Ireland's unique geographical circumstances and the impact of the Northern Ireland Protocol, we advocate for designating all ports and airports in Northern Ireland as freeports. This comprehensive approach will extend the benefits of freeports across the entire region, from Londonderry to Aldergrove, Warrenpoint, Belfast, and Larne.
We will also argue for the creation of a 'Trusted Trader' scheme to enable businesses outside secure port zones to access processing relief at zero tariff rates, maximising economic benefits for all of Northern Ireland.
Ulster Unionists are committed to fiscal responsibility and effective financial stewardship.
We aim to work with Westminster to gradually reduce Corporation Tax in Northern Ireland to 15%. Despite past fiscal mismanagement, we are determined to showcase Northern Ireland's potential for responsible financial management.
By implementing necessary reforms and reducing Corporation Tax, we seek to enhance competitiveness, attract investment and drive economic growth throughout the Northern Ireland.
We also pledge to invest in skills development through the establishment of a Northern Ireland Job Skills Fund, akin to successful programmes in Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. This fund, comprising representatives from government, business, and trade unions, will collaborate with educational institutions to provide targeted skills training aimed at enhancing productivity and bolstering the economy. We commit to dedicating funding equivalent to the UK Apprenticeship Levy paid by Northern Ireland firms, ensuring a minimum annual investment of no less than £35 million into the Skills Fund.
Ulster Unionists renew our pledge to review energy security and prices, advocating for the creation of an All-Islands (UK & Ireland) energy market to leverage the benefits of greater integration with Great Britain's energy markets.
This initiative will enhance energy security, reduce prices, and streamline regulatory oversight, ensuring a more efficient and cost- effective energy supply for Northern Ireland.
“These commitments underscore our dedication to fostering prosperity, growth, and opportunity for all regions of the UK, ensuring Northern Ireland's rightful place in the global economy.”  TAXATION & PENSIONS.
Ulster Unionist MPs pledge to prioritise fair and sustainable taxation policies that promote economic growth while ensuring the well-being of all citizens, including those that have retired. We firmly believe in maintaining the UK's 'triple lock' for state pensions, safeguarding the financial security of our elderly population.
The 'triple lock' for pensions is a commitment made by the UK government to annually increase the state pension by the highest of three measures: inflation, average earnings growth, or a minimum of 2.5%. This ensures that pensioners' incomes keep pace with the rising cost of living and national prosperity. The Ulster Unionist Party recognises the vital importance of this policy in providing dignity and security for retirees, many of whom have contributed tirelessly to our society throughout their lives.
Furthermore, we advocate for a progressive approach to taxation, ensuring that the burden is distributed equitably and that those with the means to contribute more do so responsibly.
OUR COMMITMENTS: Upholding the 'triple lock' for state pensions and implementing fair taxation policies.
We reaffirm our commitment to building a society where every individual can retire with dignity and financial stability.
 “The Ulster Unionist Party’s overall aim and vision is to build a world- leading health and social care system that is responsive, accessible and delivers quality care.”
