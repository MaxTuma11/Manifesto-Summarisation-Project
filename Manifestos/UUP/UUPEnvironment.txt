AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT.
The Ulster Unionist Party recognises the vital role that agriculture, food production, and our rural communities play in the economic and social fabric of Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom as a whole.
As the party of the Union, we are committed to supporting our farmers, agri-food businesses, and rural areas to ensure they can thrive and prosper.
The agri-food sector is the backbone of our rural economy, contributing over £5 billion to the Northern Ireland economy annually and employing over 100,000 people. From our world-renowned dairy products and beef, to our premium quality vegetables, fruits, and specialty foods, the skill and innovation of our farmers and food producers is a source of immense pride.
The Ulster Unionist Party will always champion this vital industry. We will work tirelessly to promote and grow our agriculture and food exports, opening new international markets and supporting our producers to meet the evolving demands of consumers at home and abroad.
Farmers are the bedrock of our rural communities. The Ulster Unionist Party recognises the immense challenges they face, from volatile market prices and spiralling input costs to the increasing burden of red tape and environmental regulations.
Maintain and enhance Direct Payments to farmers, ensuring they receive a fair, stable income to invest in their businesses.
Cut bureaucracy and streamline compliance processes to reduce the administrative burden on farmers.
Increase funding for research, development and knowledge transfer to drive innovation, productivity, and sustainability across the sector.
Work in partnership with farmers to develop a comprehensive, long-term strategy for the future of Northern Ireland agriculture.
Northern Ireland plays a significant role as a net exporter of agri-food products, with nearly half of all such products consumed in the rest of the UK. To meet the UK's Net Zero target, the independent Climate Change Committee has recommended an 82% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The Ulster Unionist Party embraces this recommendation and will continue to strive for an 82% or better reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 as part of our comprehensive climate mitigation strategy rather than the 100% target currently enshrined in legislation.
We recognise that the next five years are crucial in mitigating climate change, and the Ulster Unionist Party is committed to ensuring that Northern Ireland makes a fair contribution to the goal of UK Net Zero.
As part of this commitment, we support the UK's Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, which seeks to mobilise public and private investment in clean technologies such as wind, carbon capture, and hydrogen. Just as Belfast and this region played a pivotal role in the world's first Industrial Revolution, we believe that investing in clean technologies will enable Northern Ireland to contribute to a New Green Industrial Revolution and lead the world in combating climate change.
The scale and technological advancements required to achieve these goals necessitate Northern Ireland's continued partnership within the United Kingdom.
“By leveraging our cherished position within the UK, we can access the resources, expertise, and collaborative opportunities needed to accelerate our transition to a low-carbon economy and safeguard the planet for future generations.”  OUR CHANGING CLIMATE.
Trees capture carbon and woodlands provide habitats where wildlife can flourish therefore, Ulster Unionists will plant more of the right trees in the right places and do more to look after the trees and woods we already have. This will help Northern Ireland make a fair contribution to the UK’s efforts to tackle climate change whilst also helping nature to recover, reducing the risk of flooding, creating new green jobs, and improving access to trees and woods for everyone to enjoy.
OUR COMMITMENTS: Ulster Unionists understand the urgent need for a collaborative effort to address the pressing issues affecting Lough Neagh's water quality and long- term sustainability. Recent multi-agency meetings underscore the necessity of establishing a management task force inclusive of all stakeholders. This task force should oversee ongoing monitoring, management and the formulation of future plans for the Lough.
Collaboration among Stormont Executive departments, arms-length bodies, and stakeholders is vital to charting a viable path forward. It is important to maintain transparency and engagement throughout this process to effectively tackle the crisis affecting Lough Neagh.
Our party's long-standing advocacy for a unified strategy underscores the necessity of proactive measures to safeguard Lough Neagh and its surrounding environment.
Ulster Unionists will continue to press NI Water for an urgent assessment of the proximity to a critical tipping point where Lough Neagh water may become unusable for drinking. The long absence of an Executive at Stormont has exacerbated these challenges, hindering our ability to implement timely solutions.
“The Ulster Unionist Party is resolute in its commitment to preserving the ecological integrity of Lough Neagh.
Through collaborative, cross-departmental efforts, we aim to mitigate pollution, protect wildlife, and ensure the availability of clean drinking water for generations to come. All stakeholders must engage in proactive dialogue and action to address this pressing environmental crisis before irreversible damage occurs. “  WOODLANDS.
