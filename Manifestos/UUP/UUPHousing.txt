The United Kingdom is in the midst of a pressing housing crisis, with a significant number of our citizens lacking a secure place to call home. This dire situation has resulted in an alarming surge in property prices and rental costs, forcing many into a state of housing insecurity or even homelessness.
The housing crisis is a multi-faceted issue, impacting various aspects of life, from health and education to the justice system. It is imperative that all regions of the UK, including Northern Ireland, unite in their efforts to develop and implement comprehensive housing strategies to tackle this crisis.
HOUSING.
WE WILL: Press the next Government to collaborate with the devolved administrations to develop and finance a robust strategy to tackle the housing crisis effectively.
