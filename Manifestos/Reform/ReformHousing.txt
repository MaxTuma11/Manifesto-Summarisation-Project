Reform UK will ensure that people can own their own home by unleashing housebuilding across the country and cutting immigration.
CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Review the Planning System.
Fast-track planning and tax incentives for development of brownfield sites. ‘Loose fit planning’ policy for large residential developments with pre- approved guidelines and developer requirements.
Reform Social Housing Law Prioritise local people and those who have paid into the system. Foreign nationals must go to the back of the queue. Not the front.
Scrap section 24 for Landlords The tax system should encourage smaller landlords into the rental markets. Not penalise them. We will restore landlords’ rights to deduct finance costs and mortgage interest from tax on rental income.
Abolish the Renters’ (Reform) Bill Existing legislation was inadequate to address bad practices. Instead, we will boost the monitoring, appeals and enforcement process for renters with grievances.
Thereafter: Protection for Leaseholders.
All potential charges for leasehold or freehold residents must be clearly stated and consented to. Enforce Section 106 agreements. Ensure it is cheaper and easier to extend leases to 990 years and buy freeholds.
Incentivise Use of New Construction Technology.
We will incentivise innovation to speed up building: modular construction, digital technology and building sites that improve efficiency and cut waste.
HOUSING.
Britain has a Housing Crisis.
 “Affordable homes for hard-working British people.” HOUSING PLEDGES COSTS = £ NEUTRAL.
