CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Scrap Net Zero and Related Subsidies Ditching Net Zero could save the public sector over £30 billion per year for the next 25 years.

Renewables are not cheaper. Our bills have increased dramatically in line with the huge increase in renewables capacity over the last 15 years.
Cheap, Secure Energy for Britain Start fast-track licences of North Sea gas and oil.
Grant shale gas licences on test sites for 2 years.
Enable major production when safety is proven, with local compensation schemes.
Thereafter: Cleaner Energy from New Technology.
Fast-track clean nuclear energy with new Small Modular Reactors, built in Britain. Increase and incentivise ethical UK lithium mining for electric batteries, combined cycle gas turbines, clean synthetic fuel, tidal power and explore clean coal mining.
NET ZERO.
