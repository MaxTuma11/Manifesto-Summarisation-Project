Reform UK will take a pragmatic approach to getting Britain’s infrastructure back on its feet and keeping it secure from foreign threats.
CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Scrap HS2.
Save £25 billion by scrapping the rest of this bloated vanity project.
Stop the War on Drivers Legislate to ban ULEZ Clean Air Zones and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods. Scrapping Net Zero means no more bans on petrol and diesel cars and no legal requirements for manufacturers to sell electric cars.
We will keep the speed limit low where safety is critical. Otherwise, 20 MPH zones will be scrapped.
Accelerate Transport Infrastructure Focus on our coastal regions, Wales, the North, and the Midlands. Improve existing rail and road links.
Integrated services are critical.
Thereafter: Tighter Regulation and New Ownership Model for Critical National Infrastructure The British taxpayer needs to be in control of Britain’s utilities. Launch a new model that brings 50% of each utility into public ownership.
The other 50% would be owned by UK pension funds, benefiting from new expertise and better management. We will ensure standing charges are capped to help low users and pensioners.
A Single Government Infrastructure Funding Stream.
Overhaul and merge the National Infrastructure Commission and the Infrastructure Bank. Scrap Net Zero objectives. Simplify the funding process to save time, cut waste, boost funding and accountability.
TRANSPORT & UTILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE The Scandal of our Crumbling Infrastructure Must End  “Reform UK has the vision to transform Britain’s broken infrastructure.” TRANSPORT AND UTILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE PLEDGES SAVINGS = £25 BILLION ONE-OFF £5 BILLION PER YEAR OVER FIRST 5 YEARS.
