3 NORTHERN IRELAND PUBLIC FINANCES.
Northern Ireland is not adequately funded to reflect relative need, and so our capacity to sustain and transform public services is hindered. To sustain and transform our education, health and justice systems, to invest in public sector pay, drive the local economy and protect our environment, we need fair funding.
To achieve this, Alliance will: 
• Work to secure a base-lined fiscal floor, set above 124, at the next spending review. We do not believe the UK Government’s figure of 124 captures our relative need and believe this will be borne out by independent analysis that the Treasury should commission.
• Continue to press for long-term transformation and public spending on an ‘invest to save’ basis. There is much more we can do with the money we have to ensure quality public services for people in NI.
• Tackle the cost of division. Research from 2016 cited the costs of division in NI ranged between £400-800m. We want the UK Government to fund new research into the updated costs, so that we can tackle it and funnel savings back into public services.
