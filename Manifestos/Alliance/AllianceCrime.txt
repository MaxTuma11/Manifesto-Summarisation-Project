NORTHERN IRELAND PUBLIC FINANCES.
Northern Ireland is not adequately funded to reflect relative need, and so our capacity to sustain and transform public services is hindered. To sustain and transform our education, health and justice systems, to invest in public sector pay, drive the local economy and protect our environment, we need fair funding.
