CHAPTER 5 MIGRATION.
Alliance believes in a shared and united community. That means representing everyone in Northern Ireland, celebrating our community’s diversity, and upholding the rights and dignity of all.
Migration is a normal part of human life: it enriches our culture, opens our minds, causes love and families to grow, and significantly improves our economy.
Immigration must be managed, but Alliance supports a compassionate, fair system and we have always opposed the ‘hostile environment’. We believe that an immigration system can both fulfil our legal and moral responsibilities and at the same time grow our economy and improve our society.
The Conservative Party has used Brexit as a vehicle to introduce an increasingly punitive, cynical immigration system that has threatened the rule of law, human rights, our economy and the UK’s international standing.
The UK Government has perpetuated divisive mistruths and anti-migrant tropes, defying international law as well as the overwhelming economic evidence and needs of businesses.
It has also failed to provide community resources for integration and created an unprecedented backlog in processing applications.
Northern Ireland’s key sectors include retail, hospitality and tourism, agri-food and social care – all of which rely upon migrant workers.
Since 2019, Northern Ireland businesses have experienced major job shortages due to the Government’s increasingly restrictive approach to economic migration.
While immigration policy is set at Westminster, we also believe there is scope to use devolved powers to boost integration and strengthen migrant and asylum seekers’ rights in Northern Ireland. More information on these policies can be found in the Alliance 2022 Assembly Manifesto.
REFORMING THE VISA SYSTEM.
The Conservative Government has hiked up visa fees, increased qualification requirements and doubled the minimum salary levels to be eligible for a visa to work in the UK. Given lower salary levels in Northern Ireland, the impact of this policy has been particularly acute for local families. It has devastated and separated couples and families, led to major job shortages, and left untold numbers vulnerable to exploitation.
Alliance MPs will campaign for changes so that our economy and businesses can thrive, families can be together, and all of us can live and work in dignity. We will support action to: 
• Reverse the increased minimum threshold salary requirements for family visas and make the system affordable.
• Scrap the ban on dependents for those on a Health and Care Worker visa and student visa.
• End punitive, unjust policies such as No Recourse to Public Funds.
• Cut extortionate visa fees and make visa renewals automatic and affordable.
• Repeal the Immigration Act 2020 to scrap the shortage occupation list and points- based system, creating a visa system based on the real needs of the Northern Ireland economy and society.
• End employer-dependent visas so workers can change jobs or leave an exploitative employer.
• Reject the assertion that workers in critical low-paid front-line roles are “low-skilled” and therefore ineligible to work in the UK.
• Cap routes to settlement at five years, and create a simplified route to status based on five years’ residence.
• Grant overseas students two years to find work after graduation.
OVERHAULING THE ASYLUM SYSTEM.
The annual number of asylum applications to the UK peaked in 2002, and people who originally came to the UK seeking asylum make up a mere 0.6% of the UK’s total population. This small minority is not responsible for the systemic issues in our economy: the under-resourcing of our public services is.
Under the current system, it is virtually impossible to seek asylum in the UK legally, and entering the UK via irregular journeys is the only way people can seek sanctuary.
The UK therefore takes a tiny fraction of the world’s refugees. Most asylum seekers stay in the first country they feel safe. The small minority that travel onwards to reach the UK do so because they have ties to the country: familial, historical and language – some have even served with the British military, as is the case for many Afghan arrivals.
Around 85% of refugees globally live in developing regions, with 73% of refugees living in countries neighbouring the one they have fled.
Over recent years, smuggling gangs have capitalised on heightened border security between the UK and France and the UK’s departure from the EU. With fewer irregular journeys to claim asylum made by lorry and other vehicles, asylum seekers are forced to reach the UK via treacherous small boat crossings.
The Conservative Government has spread the notion that people arriving on these boats are making bogus claims. In reality, 92% of small boat arrivals from 2018 to March 2023 claimed asylum, with over 86% of those who had received a decision by March 2023 being offered protection.
The Conservative Government’s extreme approach to immigration is not based on evidence and does not stop people from entering the UK. Instead, it emboldens smuggling gangs and puts untold numbers at risk of death in the Channel, modern slavery, human trafficking and exploitation in the informal economy. In particular, Rwanda-style schemes are impacting people’s willingness to come forward as victims of human trafficking, and the inability to work is causing significant vulnerability to economic, sexual and criminal exploitation.
The only meaningful way to reduce treacherous Channel crossings is to provide safe routes for asylum seekers to reach the UK and to expand the UK’s highly restrictive family reunification criteria.
MPs will work to: 
• Restore the universal right to seek asylum by repealing the Illegal Migration Act 2023, Nationality and Borders Act 2022, Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024.
• Abolish the Rwanda Scheme and any other third-country forced resettlement agreements.
• Establish safe, legal routes to claim asylum in the UK, expanding resettlement schemes and making it easier for vulnerable family members to be reunited.
• Process asylum claims fairly and quickly in a trauma-informed way, without discriminating based on the method of travel.
• Grant asylum seekers the right to work in any job after three months so they can support themselves and their families and become active members of their communities.
• Call for more investment for communities to support asylum seekers and promote integration.
• End the use of hotels and privatisation of accommodation for those seeking asylum, moving to a not-for-profit-based system that’s integrated into communities and works alongside social housing.
• Make providers of asylum accommodation subject to a statutory duty to refer people leaving asylum support accommodation who are at risk of homelessness to the local housing authority.
• Ensure that migrants’ and refugees’ qualifications and prior learning are recognised to reflect need in the local economy and to ensure they can continue their education and find employment that corresponds to their skills.
• Explore options to strengthen and streamline community sponsorship.
• Call for adequate funding for the Northern Ireland Strategic Migration Partnership (NISMP) and improved governance across the UK.
• Establish independent monitoring of all accommodation provisions for those seeking asylum to ensure adequate health and safety precautions and safeguarding.
• Support a trial in Northern Ireland to explore community-based Alternatives to Detention (ATDs).
PROTECTING THE COMMON TRAVEL AREA.
The Common Travel Area is a mixture of conventions and legal instruments that govern movement and reciprocal rights across the UK and Ireland. As a consequence of Brexit, it has been placed under growing stress.
Furthermore, we have seen attempts to redefine the Common Travel Area (CTA) based exclusively around the rights of British and Irish nationals, resulting in unjust restrictions on migrant communities and reports of increasing racial profiling on cross- border journeys.
It is critical that the integrity of the Common Travel Area is upheld and that its rights are afforded to all those lawfully resident in the United Kingdom and in Ireland. In Westminster, Alliance MP Stephen Farry successfully secured an exemption for third- party non-visa nationals living on the island of Ireland from the UK’s Electronic Travel Authorisation.
The Irish and UK Governments must work together to protect residents’ CTA rights and make a positive case for immigration, showing that we can handle arrivals in a way that unlocks economic opportunities and fulfils international human rights responsibilities.
Alliance MPs will work to ensure that: 
• The Common Travel Area is placed on a formal treaty basis by the UK and Irish Governments.
• Essential cross-border services be made available to all legally resident non-EU/EEA citizens on the island of Ireland.
• Non-EU/EEA residents who have lawful residency in Northern Ireland are provided “deemed permission” to cross the border as visitors.
• A social mobility assessment is undertaken for migrant communities on the island of Ireland.
• The requirement for non-EU/EEA citizens to carry and produce passports when crossing the border and to notify authorities of their visit in advance of travel is abolished.
• An exemption for Northern Ireland tourism is created under the UK’s Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme.
• A labour mobility scheme on the island of Ireland is created.
