LEADER’S FOREWORD, Naomi Long Leader of the Alliance Party.
This election is a chance not only to remove a negative, destructive Conservative government but also to hold to account those local politicians who propped up, supported and backed some of their most divisive, regressive policies.
We have a chance for change.
But to make that change happen, you have to help us deliver it.
On Thursday the 4th of July, you have the opportunity to make a positive change to your life and the lives of everyone in Northern Ireland. To positively influence the issues that matter to you most. To support a united community and reduce division in our society.
To ensure you have positive representation at Westminster, committed to a more prosperous and fair society for everyone.
Together, we can lead that change. Your support plus our commitment to delivery equals a brighter, more optimistic future for everyone.
If that’s the sort of leadership you want, play your part.
On July 4th, Vote Alliance.
We stand ready to expand our team in Westminster, returning Stephen Farry alongside more Alliance MPs. Building on our successes in the 2022 Assembly election and local government elections last year, we know that people want strong Alliance representation at all levels of government.
Alliance is already leading change on better health outcomes, making our communities safer, expanding inclusive education and delivering affordable childcare. We are working to combat climate change, promote a cleaner, greener environment and to create a vibrant and dynamic economy.
In this Westminster manifesto, we have set out our policy priorities for the next five-year term. We have focused specifically on those matters over which Westminster has direct control or influence. This isn’t a stand-alone document – to get the fullest picture of how Alliance plans to deliver better; it should be read in conjunction with our Local Government and Assembly manifestos and our policy documents on Childcare, Institutional Reform and our Green New Deal.
Crucially, we can use increased influence at Westminster to unlock a fairer financial deal for Northern Ireland and advance reform of the Assembly and Executive so no one party can collapse things ever again. Fairer funding and stable institutions add up to more sustainable politics and public services – a brighter future for everyone.
Alliance is growing as more people recognise that a divided society means less for everyone. The cost of division means hundreds of millions of pounds less to invest each year in what really matters to you.
DEPUTY LEADER’S FOREWORD, Stephen Farry Deputy Leader of the Alliance Party.
I have been steadfast in defending Northern Ireland from a hard Brexit. I consistently opposed destructive unilateral actions from the Conservatives and the DUP, which would have severely damaged our economy. Instead, I have worked to provide practical solutions to a range of problems, and build a closer relationship between the UK and EU will remain a major priority in the forthcoming Parliament.
As the leading advocate for reforming Northern Ireland’s political institutions in Westminster, I have worked tirelessly to ensure that we never again face a situation where they collapse, leaving a political vacuum and long-term damage to our economy and public services. I have consistently stood up for all our rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law, pushing back against divisive and toxic Tory rhetoric, and opposing regressive legislation.
The Alliance Party recognises that trust in politics is crucial for an effective democratic society. I am determined to help restore that trust by promoting transparency, accountability, and integrity in public life.
I hope to be returned to Parliament with colleagues so that we can build on this success, using our influence at Westminster to make Northern Ireland a better place for everyone.
It has been my greatest privilege to represent North Down in Westminster over the past four years. My dedication to serving the people of North Down has been unwavering and I am proud of my track record: delivering on behalf of my constituents and making their voices heard.
My small team and I have consistently punched well above our weight and achieved a great deal in this Parliament. I have used my platform to tackle crucial issues facing Northern Ireland and beyond, in line with the Alliance Party’s vision of a shared and integrated society, ensuring fairness, inclusivity, and prosperity for all.
I led the charge in securing the £3.3 billion financial package for Northern Ireland, providing much-needed relief to support our public services and economy while continuing to advocate for sustainable, long-term solutions.
I have championed calls for the UK Government’s fiscal rules to adopt a more long-term approach to investment, recognise the indirect costs of environmental inaction, and unlock essential funding for public services.
The Alliance Party has pioneered the concept of a Green New Deal for Northern Ireland, aiming to create new green jobs, promote social justice, and save our planet.
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
1 LEADING CHANGE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND.
Northern Ireland has transformed in many ways since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. But while our society, our economy and even our politics have evolved, our institutions have not, and they are now holding back progress.
We believe: 
• Northern Ireland deserves better than stop-start politics. Our institutions should be reformed to prevent any one party from holding them hostage ever again.
• In a society for everyone, underpinned by our shared values of equality, respect for diversity and interdependence. Funding should be released for key projects such as integrated schools and early years investment that will help us build a shared future.
• That justice should have no time limit, and we support those seeking truth, justice and acknowledgement for the events of the past. The Legacy Act should be replaced with an alternative that has the support of victims and local parties.
2 UK PUBLIC FINANCES.
Public services have been squeezed beyond recognition and the UK’s public finances are in a very bad place. Without reform, current UK fiscal policy is inhibiting investment, reinforcing climate inaction and storing up environmental, social and financial crises for the future.
We want to see: 
• Changes to the Fiscal Rules, so the impact of public spending decisions on the UK’s overall asset base (or wealth) is reflected, rather than just its impact on debt. This would better capture and reflect the costs associated with climate inaction, unlock vital investment in struggling public services, incentivise investment in our infrastructure and skills, as well as provide resilience to external shocks and risks such as climate change.
• A progressive taxation system, where the super-wealthy pay their fair share, and the phased implementation of carbon taxes to raise more money for public services, and to progress the transition to net zero.
• A radical rethink of the social security system. Food bank use is rising and people are often unable to survive on the inadequate income benefits provide.
• A major investment in childcare, both through a bespoke model in Northern Ireland and through tax relief at Westminster.
3 NORTHERN IRELAND PUBLIC FINANCES.
Northern Ireland is not adequately funded to reflect relative need, and so our capacity to sustain and transform public services is hindered. To sustain and transform our education, health and justice systems, to invest in public sector pay, drive the local economy and protect our environment, we need fair funding.
To achieve this, Alliance will: 
• Work to secure a base-lined fiscal floor, set above 124, at the next spending review. We do not believe the UK Government’s figure of 124 captures our relative need and believe this will be borne out by independent analysis that the Treasury should commission.
• Continue to press for long-term transformation and public spending on an ‘invest to save’ basis. There is much more we can do with the money we have to ensure quality public services for people in NI.
• Tackle the cost of division. Research from 2016 cited the costs of division in NI ranged between £400-800m. We want the UK Government to fund new research into the updated costs, so that we can tackle it and funnel savings back into public services.
4 ECONOMY.
We believe Northern Ireland can become Europe's most innovative and dynamic regional economy. We have many strengths, including unique dual market access. Whilst many economic levers lie in the hands of the NI Executive, Westminster can and should do more to enable NI’s growth.
We want to see: 
• The promotion of dual market access for Northern Ireland. The Windsor Framework provides NI with a relative opportunity compared to the rest of the UK in relation to unfettered access for goods. This opportunity should be exploited to the benefit of businesses and people in NI.
• The Apprenticeship Levy reviewed, with any levy raised from Northern Ireland ring- fenced for re-investment in skills.
• Renewed partnerships between Government and local businesses in NI on a North-South and East-West basis.
• Support for regional industries by boosting research, innovation, skills, infrastructure and access to finance across the entire UK.
• A legal duty placed on the UK Government to ensure its economic policies are assessed on their likelihood of reducing regional inequality in the economy and that levelling up is accelerated.
• A fundamental review of the Levelling Up and Shared Prosperity Funds, so that they support local priorities in NI and are controlled by the NI Executive.
5 GREEN NEW DEAL.
We believe tackling the climate emergency goes hand in hand with economic transformation and social justice. In 2021, we published the Alliance Green New Deal that sets out our plan for a fair, green economy.
Since then, energy prices and the cost of living have reached a crisis point due to the Conservative Government's reckless inaction and u-turns on critical climate pledges.
We will continue to make the case for a Green New Deal. We believe: 
• Energy security is more important than ever. We must invest in renewable energy to guard against price precarity and to boost the industry in Northern Ireland.
• We need a UK-wide emergency retrofitting programme to reduce emissions and tackle fuel poverty.
• A just transition to net zero, part funded through tax increases on fossil fuel giants and wealth, property taxes on the super- rich and via long-term green bond issuance, ISAs and pension funds.
• The use of fossil fuels should end, with a ban on fracking and the opening of new coal mines and pits.
6 MIGRATION.
Alliance believes in a united community. That means representing everyone in Northern Ireland, celebrating the diversity of our communities and upholding the rights and dignity of us all.
We reject the current rhetoric around migrants and asylum seekers, and we support a fair and compassionate immigration system for the UK that recognises the invaluable role migrants play in our economy.
 We want to see: 
 • An overhaul of the visa system to make it more affordable and the removal of cruel minimum threshold salary requirements for family visas.
• The scrapping of the shortage occupation list and points-based system, replacing it with a visa system based on the real needs of Northern Ireland’s economy and society.
• The creation of safe routes for asylum seekers to reduce exploitation and trafficking, and so that no one is forced to make treacherous journeys to the UK.
• The Rwanda Scheme abolished, and asylum claims processed quickly in a trauma-informed way.
• The right to work for asylum seekers in any job after three months so they can support themselves and their families and become active members of their communities.
7 UK POLITICAL REFORM, HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUALITY.
Just as Alliance stands for openness, honestly and fairness in Stormont, we will continue to seek to enshrine these values in Westminster.
We believe human rights, equality and the rule of law are cornerstones of safety and stability, and must be defended more robustly than ever after the last Government.
Alliance MPs will demand: 
• A fairer electoral system for the House of Commons, and a directly-elected House of Lords.
• Votes at 16 for all elections and referendums.
• A trans-inclusive ban on so-called Conversion Therapy that extends to NI.
• Better regulation of AI and social media, including a watchdog for child safety online.
8 OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION.
We believe Brexit was and continues to be fundamentally destructive for the UK as a whole. For Northern Ireland, it poses huge challenges for our economy, environment, society and wider political stability.
We support the special arrangements provided for under the Windsor Framework but we want to improve its implementation to help people and businesses in NI.
We want: 
• A negotiated Veterinary Medicines Agreement and a grace period for the next phase of goods labelling in the interim.
• Improved information and assistance to businesses based in Great Britain regarding trading in NI.
• Early and enhanced engagement between Northern Ireland’s elected representatives, Executive departments and other stakeholders in the development of EU law.
9 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE.
International cooperation is essential in addressing shared global challenges. Alliance is guided by our liberal internationalist values and our commitment to the rules-based international order.
The world is an uncertain place, faced with many challenges. With these principles in mind, Alliance will: • Work towards a two-state solution in the Middle East, based on international law.
This includes the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state and an end to the illegal occupation of Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
• Continue in our support for Ukraine’s fight for freedom against Russian aggression and for the ongoing provision of aid to Ukraine.
• Push to reinstate the Department for International Development and for spending on Official Development Assistance of 0.7% of the UK’s gross national income.
