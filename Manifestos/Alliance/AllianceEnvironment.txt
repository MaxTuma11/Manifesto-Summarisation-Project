CHAPTER 4 GREEN NEW DEAL.
The climate crisis has existential implications for our planet and humanity. The world, and particularly the UK, is not on course to meet net-zero targets of the Paris Climate Agreement, which is considered the bare minimum to preserve a liveable planet.
A Green New Deal recognises that tackling the climate emergency goes hand in hand with economic transformation and social justice. It’s about urgently decarbonising our economy, and in doing so, unlocking a fairer, more resilient economy filled with clean, affordable, renewable energy and well-paid, secure green jobs in existing and emerging industries.
The impacts of climate change are already upon us, hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. We are experiencing increasing flooding, and changes in the natural environment, habitats and biodiversity.
Extreme weather changes will only continue to accelerate, causing needless financial distress for households, businesses and public services if we don’t future-proof our infrastructure and meet net zero targets.
As a Party, Alliance has long recognised that we need urgent action to overcome the climate crisis and improve our environment and economic wellbeing.
This is why, in 2021, we developed the Alliance Green New Deal: our plan for a fair, green economy.
Since we published the Alliance Green New Deal, energy prices and the cost of living have reached crisis point. The Conservatives have u-turned on critical climate pledges, recklessly approving fossil fuel expansion in the North Sea and failing to insulate the UK’s inefficient homes.
Furthermore, over the past 15 years, the Conservatives have underinvested in our economy by over half a trillion pounds when compared to the G7 average, leaving our public services and infrastructure in desperate need of Green New Deal investment and transformation.
Since the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, it is imperative that we reassess our progress in meeting our climate targets. It is worth noting that while the European Union continues to strengthen its climate legislation, the United Kingdom’s legislation is being weakened. We can no longer let this be the case.
Alliance MPs will continue to demand that the UK Government puts in place a Green New Deal for the UK as a whole, in line with our Alliance Green New Deal policies.
With Alliance MLA Andrew Muir now Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Alliance is leading climate action at every level of government. This includes working towards a specific Green New Deal for Northern Ireland by the Executive and the Assembly, which covers devolved responsibilities.
TACKLING THE ENERGY CRISIS.
It has been estimated that as many as 45% of homes in Northern Ireland might now be living in fuel poverty. This is unacceptable.
In today’s world of rapid change and precarity, we need affordable running costs for households and resilient infrastructure and public services that can adapt quickly and effectively to changing demands – a consideration that is increasingly vital, given emerging geopolitical risks and their associated impacts on the cost of living. This means a national plan for massive investment in renewables and properly insulating our homes.
The initial expenses of overhauling our energy infrastructure can be covered through a mix of public and private investment, with increased taxes on the wealthiest individuals – i.e. the richest 1% of people in the UK with a total wealth of £2.8tn – helping to stabilise the economy. Reforming wealth taxes on the super-rich has been estimated to generate up to £50 billion annually.
Although many energy powers are devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive, the renewable energy industry stands ready to bring incredible opportunities for Northern Ireland and should be championed by Northern Ireland’s MPs.
KEY GREEN NEW DEAL COMMITMENTS.
Alliance MPs will work in close collaboration with our Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to demand the UK Government paves the most ambitious and just path possible to Net Zero.
We will build on our work holding the UK Government to account to meet, and where possible exceed, international climate commitments, by implementing a comprehensive climate action plan for the UK.
This includes, but is not limited to: 
• Embedding environmentalism at the heart of planning and delivery, at every level of Government.
• Ending the use of fossil fuels, banning fracking and the opening of new coalmines and pits, and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy.
• Upholding Net Zero goals and opposing destructive policy rollbacks from the Conservative Government, including reversing new oil and gas licences.
• Demanding tax increases on fossil fuel giants, and wealth and property taxes on the super-rich to create equity in the tax system and support the transition to Net Zero and an end to fuel poverty.
• Creating of a “wealth tax” for the top 1% of UK earners who are responsible for 26 times the carbon emissions of the bottom 10%.
• Funding a Green New Deal via long term bond issuance, ISAs and Pension Funds.
• Requiring the UK Government to change current approaches to spending and taxation. See more on this in our Finance chapter.
• Enhancing collaborative relationships between UK Government and devolved administrations in relation to climate policy.
• Ensuring UK Government recognises transboundary issues in relation to agriculture and the environment, including in relation to marine plan.
• Strengthening the powers of the Groceries Code Adjudicator to ensure fair trading practices for farmers.
• Ensuring adequate funding for Agriculture, Rural Affairs and Fisheries sectors to enable a genuine just transition.
• Calling for enhanced funding for the Office of Environmental Protection to ensure adequate enforcement and on ground presence.
• Ensuring Northern Ireland receives its fair share of funding raised under the UK’s Emissions Trading Scheme.
• Scrutinising every UK-wide energy package to ensure it prioritises renewable energy and acts to keep prices as low as possible.
• Continuing the development of the UK Net Zero Carbon Buildings Standard and supporting a UK-wide emergency programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, including providing insulation to cut emissions and fuel bills, retrofitting homes and increasing energy efficiency of private rented sector homes and social housing, ultimately ending fuel poverty for good.
• Introducing UK air quality limits in line with World Health Organisation levels to guarantee and monitor the right to breathe clean air both indoors and outdoors.
• Supporting the continued existence of the all-island energy market, and ensure its continued effective operation despite the ongoing changes around implementation due to the Protocol and Windsor Framework.
• Securing research and development investment in Northern Ireland to match other UK regions, realising Northern Ireland’s potential as a leader in green innovation.
• Establishing citizens’ assemblies to work alongside the UK Government, under the Parliament’s scrutiny, to ensure that a just and democratic transition involves all of us, especially those most affected.
• Strengthening just transition principles through expanding the UK’s climate disclosure regulations to require every UK listed company to make just transition plans and to involve their workforce and trade unions in this planning.
• Scrapping the Conservatives’ anti-protest laws to support trade unions’ right to organise and advocate during the just transition.
• Banning advertising for high-carbon products.
Animal Welfare.
In addition to protecting biodiversity, wildlife and habitats, Alliance has always prioritised animal welfare and sought to tackle cruelty against animals. People who show such brutality are not only a danger to the animals involved but potentially to our society as a whole.
We will continue to pursue high welfare standards at the UK level and to use the UK’s influence to end global “trophy hunting” and the trade of illegal animal products. We remain committed to extending the ban on hunting mammals with dogs to Northern Ireland.
