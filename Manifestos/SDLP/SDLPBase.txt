SDLP MANIFESTO WESTMINSTER 2024.
 An Election for Change.
Leader’s Message.
This election is about change.
It is the clearest opportunity we have had in more than a decade to put an end to the politics of austerity, isolation and division that have driven governments for 14 brutal years.
It is a chance for Northern Ireland not just to send a message against failed policies of austerity and ever-hardening Tory nationalism, but to send MPs that will use their voice and their influence to fight for all the people of this region.
A Change Election.
For months now, SDLP representatives have been speaking to people from every background and in every community across the North.
We have heard first-hand accounts from people who’ve been forced to take out credit union loans to pay for private healthcare, from nurses and junior doctors, running themselves into the ground to make sure that the people in their care get the best possible outcomes, to young people who can’t afford to buy their first home, pensioners struggling to keep the heat on (even in June) and others lucky enough to get on the property ladder who are at their wit’s end because they can’t keep up with sky high mortgage prices.
How could you not be frustrated with the way things are? After 14 years of brutal Tory governments, public services are on life support, our health service has already started to collapse, wages have stagnated and costs are through the roof. And in the middle of it all, the two local parties charged with leading devolved Government at Stormont both decided to tear it down for years at a time, leaving us unprotected from unfiltered Tory austerity.
It doesn’t have to be like this.
Using our voice.
Almost five years ago people from every community came together to cast their votes for change. After two years where the only voices from here at Westminster were the DUP, who used that power to cause chaos, voters came out in huge numbers and decided to use their voice. In an election where we were all told that we couldn’t make a difference, people decided to choose change. They sent more than just a message - they sent hardworking SDLP MPs who have fought for them, their family and our communities every single day.
And we have delivered.
We’ve secured almost £100m for university expansion in the North West.
We delivered a step change in investment from the Irish Government through the Shared Island Unit worth more than £1bn for projects like Narrow Water Bridge, the A5, Casement Park and far more.
 We’ve brought new regeneration funds to redevelop and enhance town and city centres and we’ve seen investment in addiction services to help the most vulnerable people and families who need our help.
We’ve done all that, and more, with a Tory government - imagine what we could do with a Labour government that understands this place and listens to the views of our MPs.
SDLP MPs are best placed to deliver change because we will have the strongest relationship with a new government. Other parties have done deals with the Tories in their own self-interest or won’t bother turning up to make a difference. By contrast, SDLP MPs will be there where it counts and when it counts to deliver for everyone in our communities.
Raise your voice.
SDLP MPs have made sure that our voice - and your voice - is heard. On the issues that matter to people - standing up for our health service, demanding oil and gas companies pay higher taxes on their profits to support people struggling with the cost of living, fighting for investment in public services, jobs and skills - we have been loud and clear.
And on burning international issues - we have been the most vocal champions for peace. Claire Hanna and I have been the strongest opponents of the blank cheque written by the British Prime Minister and the American President for the onslaught against the Palestinian people.
We have spoken hard truths to our political rivals and our allies when they’ve got this wrong.
And while others enjoyed parties in the White House, we stood in solidarity with people here who have always supported peace and an end to the genocide.
In Stormont, people are already seeing the impact that our constructive SDLP Opposition voice is having: holding the Executive to account on moving beyond rhetoric towards delivery of a plan to rescue public services.
That’s what you get with SDLP MPs - representatives who stand their ground, stick to their principles and fight for you, whatever the political weather.
A chance for change.
After more than a decade of austerity, isolation, division and deadlock we have a chance for change. It is a chance for a new start for all of us.
On 4th July, take that chance. Vote SDLP.
