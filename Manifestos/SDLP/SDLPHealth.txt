Saving the Health Service. The health service in Northern Ireland is under immense strain The Transformation agenda has stalled due to the constant collapse of government, a failure to fund strategic change and a lack of political will. Instead, local services have been pushed beyond breaking point and many communities are now experiencing core service withdrawal which has eroded confidence in the transformation programme.
Waiting lists continue to grow and those waiting for treatment continue to wait for far too long. Over half a million people are currently waiting for an appointment - more than 1 in 4 of our entire population - and more than half of those people are likely to wait for more than a year on a first outpatient session.
Our nurses, junior doctors, consultants and essential health service staff are working themselves to exhaustion for less pay and in poorer conditions than anywhere else on these islands.
It isn’t good enough.
The North’s Health Service needs a Marshall Plan style intervention, acknowledging the scale of underinvestment in services, the urgency of transformation to benefit patients, health service staff and communities across Northern Ireland.
Working alongside the SDLP Opposition at Stormont, SDLP MPs will: Make representations directly to the Treasury for a health service transformation intervention; Seek dedicated resource to reduce waiting lists which have remained out of control; Argue for terms and conditions for health service staff which reflect their contribution to our society and address workforce retention challenges; Argue for a government backed indemnity scheme for GPs in Northern Ireland to avert the unnecessary closure of local practices; Fight for the expansion of Multi-Disciplinary Teams across Northern Ireland.
