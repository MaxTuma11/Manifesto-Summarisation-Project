Sinn Féin is committed to an inclusive and diverse society based on equal rights and equal opportunities for all citizens.
There can be no place for sectarianism, racism, misogyny, homophobia, age or disability discrimination in our society.
The scourge of violence against women and girls must be addressed and an Ending Violence Against Women and Girls’ (EVAWG) strategy must be delivered.
We want to create a safe, welcoming and inclusive society for all.
We want a society that values and celebrates the diversity of our identities, religious or none, sexual orientation, gender, disability, age, or ethnic origin.
We want women to be able to access the safe and legal health services they are entitled to.
We want to see parity of esteem for Irish culture and language as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.
Sinn Féin will also uphold the rights of all victims of the conflict to information, maximum disclosure, and truth.
We vigorously oppose the provisions outlined in the British Government’s Legacy Act.
It’s time to address the legacy of the past by implementing the mechanisms agreed at Stormont House in a human rights compliant manner.
Sinn Féin will also continue to advocate for victims and survivors of institutional abuse to protect their right to truth, justice and redress that they have been denied for too long.
