Sinn FÃ©in is committed to delivering on the things that matter most to workers and families: healthcare, the cost of living, housing, education, childcare.
There is now a real opportunity to shape a more prosperous future in a stronger, better and fairer country.
An opportunity to create an efficient all-Ireland national health service, a sustainable housing system, affordable childcare, and a fair and just transition to a carbon neutral economy.
