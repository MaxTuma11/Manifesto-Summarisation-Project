We want a stronger and fairer economy that delivers good jobs that pay well, offers workers secure conditions, and supports local business.
We want to increase productivity and opportunities for skills and training, regional balance in investment and job opportunities, accessible and affordable childcare - including for those with Special Educational Needs - and meet climate change targets through a fair and just transition to net zero.
We are committed to strong legal protections for workers and the right to join a trade union.
We are also committed to delivering the flagship projects committed to by the Executive such as the Magee University expansion, building the A5 and A6 roads, and the redevelopment of Casement Park.
Other projects that promote regional balance and the development of the all-island economy, such as Narrow Water Bridge and the Ulster Canal, must also be delivered.
We will continue to fight for a fair funding model for the North which meets the needs of public services.
Sinn FÃ©in has been central to the fightback against the negative, cuts-driven and destructive policies of the Tories, securing unique protections against the worst excesses of Brexit and austerity.
We will continue to offer strong leadership to all our people and communities with a commitment to work together with everyone to deliver positive change.
