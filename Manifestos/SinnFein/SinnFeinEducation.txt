Sinn Féin is committed to standing up for workers, families, rural and urban communities, to ensure they have access to first-class public services.
We need to see an end to the chronic underfunding of our public services and the undervaluing of our public service workers.
Sinn Féin has consistently challenged the British Government’s under-funding of our public services - including its failure to give certainty to community organisations and farmers regarding the replacement of EU Funding.
We are also committed to delivering the flagship projects committed to by the Executive such as the Magee University expansion.
