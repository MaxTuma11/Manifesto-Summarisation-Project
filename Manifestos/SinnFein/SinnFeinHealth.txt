Sinn Féin is committed to standing up for workers, families, rural and urban communities, to ensure they have access to first-class public services.
We need to see an end to the chronic underfunding of our public services and the undervaluing of our public service workers.
Sinn Féin has consistently challenged the British Government’s under-funding of our public services - including its failure to give certainty to community organisations and farmers regarding the replacement of EU Funding.
We also want to see multi-annual budgeting so that the Executive is better equipped to plan and make longer term investments such as tackling hospital waiting lists, rather than limiting departments to managing their budgets on a year-to-year basis.
There is now a real opportunity to shape a more prosperous future in a stronger, better and fairer country.
An opportunity to create an efficient all-Ireland national health service, a sustainable housing system, affordable childcare, and a fair and just transition to a carbon neutral economy.
