Childcare for Working Parents The lack of access to affordable, flexible and high-quality childcare has a negative impact on employment and recruitment and retention of staff in frontline services in particular. In many cases, parents are working reduced or condensed hours, or not all, in order to meet childcare needs, due to cost and availability of alternative provision. For this reason, the DUP Education Minister Paul Givan MLA has announced a fresh package of measures worth £25 million designed to: 3 stabilise and support expansion of the early learning and childcare sector; 3 offer all children 22.5 hours pre-school education per week, and; 3 reduce childcare bills for working parents through a Northern Ireland Childcare Subsidy Scheme.
DUP MPs will campaign to: 3 deliver increased economic and educational opportunities for young people by building relationships across the United Kingdom, including through the U.K East-West Council; 3 promote a joined-up approach to educational under-achievement across our four nations, with a focus on adult numeracy; 3 reduce disparities in support between under-20s who undertake apprenticeships and those in this age group who remain in school or education, including through retaining child benefit or subsidising travel costs; 3 reintroduce financial incentives for businesses that hire young apprentices at risk of long-term unemployment; 3 promote apprenticeships as part of a strategy for supporting young people leaving care; 3 seek to address the soaring cost of motor insurance for young people, including through exploring the potential for measures such as: • graduated driving licences; • a restriction on the number of young passengers; • a lower blood alcohol limit for young drivers.
