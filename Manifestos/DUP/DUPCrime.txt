Northern Ireland-Related Terrorism.
In Northern Ireland, there is an enduring threat posed by dissident republicans and the repugnant and life- changing attack on DCI John Caldwell underlines the need for a sustained, laser-sharp focus on rooting out those still intent on perpetrating murder and bloodshed on our streets. We welcome the role played by the national intelligence community in helping to erode the capabilities of splinter groups like the New IRA and to take prominent terrorists out of circulation.
Our security forces should have at their disposal the powers and autonomy required to defeat these groups. The DUP will advocate for an uplift in funding provided by the Government for additional security needs in Northern Ireland. We also want to address lengthy delays trying terrorism cases in our courts, whilst bringing sentencing for serious offences into line with higher tariffs elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
It is unacceptable that terrorist defendants should be given different sentences depending on whether they are arrested and prosecuted in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. The DUP supports enshrining a presumption that there should be consistency of sentencing principles for such cases throughout the United Kingdom.
This should be delivered through the creation of a sentencing guidelines body akin to those established in Scotland, and in England and Wales, to ensure the ongoing injustice of shorter sentences being imposed for terrorism offences in Northern Ireland is addressed.
Foreign Development Aid The DUP wants to see the United Kingdom consolidate its position as one of the world’s most generous donors of foreign aid. We will achieve this by urging the next Government to: restore the UK foreign aid budget to 0.7% of gross national income (GNI); spend a higher proportion of the foreign aid budget on bilateral aid and humanitarian assistance - more than a quarter was spent inside the UK in 2023; review the number and profile of countries currently in receipt of UK aid; target more support toward poorer nations.
Standing Up for Victims of Crime Online Harm.
The DUP will campaign to end the ‘Wild West’ of social media and to protect children and all internet users from harm, abuse and misinformation online. Our MPs supported key aspects of the Online Safety Act, including: age verification for social media and pornography sites; risk assessments by social media platforms; new duties on platforms to remove illegal and harmful content and prevent it being shared; new criminal offences for encouraging self-harm, trolling, cyber-flashing and targeting people with epilepsy online with harmful content; sanctions and fines for social media platforms.
While we are clear that freedom of speech must be protected, and that what is legal offline must also be legal online, there is much more to do to build safer online communities.
We will: campaign to ensure that smaller and emerging social media platforms and sites hosting potential harmful content are subject to regulatory controls and Ofcom oversight; oppose a lower minimum age for social media use, recognising that: • it is wrong to penalise children and young people for the failures of platforms; • it could dilute focus on more proactive regulation by big tech companies; • social media remains a key tool for children to socialise and learn; • it would likely displace risk to other settings, including gaming platforms; promote strategies to reduce the risks of end-to-end encryption for children and young people online; consider the merits of a duty of candour for social media firms; seek a better alignment of Ofcom’s responsibilities to target and monitor reductions in harm online; support a rapid review of emerging risks from AI, including chatbots; work to support progress on stronger rights for bereaved parents in accessing their child’s social media profiles and data; support ring-fencing receipts from fines levied on social media companies as part of the Online Safety Act for online harm prevention and reduction; identify policies to address gaps in existing regulation of online services, including harmful content hosted on app stores; agree a statutory definition of grooming.
A Voice for Victims The 1998 Belfast Agreement resulted in the early release of terrorists and ensured that anyone later convicted of a Troubles-related offence would serve a maximum of two years in prison. Letters of Comfort were later provided to on-the-run suspects. This erosion of the rule of law was never justified.
Two decades later, it is still unacceptable.
The Government’s decision to grant an amnesty in all but name to those responsible for wrongdoing under the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act would extinguish the flame of justice for many innocent victims.
The DUP will support efforts to repeal this legislation as well as resist attempts to rewrite the past.
Since 2007, the DUP has: delivered on our policy of a Troubles victims’ pension, ensuring not a single penny is handed to perpetrators; overseen a fundamental reform of victim support services; created a Victims Commission and Victims Forum; secured the appointment of a Victims Commissioner; quadrupled the level of funding provided to victims and survivors under Direct Rule; ensured the needs of victims who are not part of advocacy organisations are also addressed; introduced a Private Member’s Bill in the House of Commons to provide a UK- wide definition of a victim which excludes those killed by their own hand; guaranteed the full implementation of Armed Forces Covenant in Northern Ireland; appointed a Veterans Commissioner; established a Victims’ Charter to prioritise the needs of victims within our criminal justice system and set minimum standards for support; pressed for compensation for victims of IRA weapons supplied by the Gaddafi regime in Libya; ensured memorials to murdered police officers are not placed out of sight in PSNI stations; raised alleged Irish Government collusion in IRA atrocities.
In the last mandate, DUP MPs: vociferously opposed the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023; ensured no Troubles-era offender could gain immunity from prosecution for sexual offences; proposed a new and bespoke criminal offence of glorifying terrorism; sought legal protection against recipients of Government amnesty profiting from activities linked to their offending, including criminal memoirs, or contacting victims or their families; delivered the Troubles pension for innocent victims, securing a commitment in law that victim-makers will not receive a single penny; supported the Omagh families’ call, and the High Court’s recommendation, for a public inquiry; tabled a debate in Parliament on the findings of the inquest into the Kingsmill Massacre; We will: support innocent victims in robustly challenging the Government’s amnesty legislation in the courts; urge UK Ministers to repeal the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act within the first 100 days of the next Parliament; prioritise a victim-centred and victim-led approach to investigating the past; guarantee continued funding for the Troubles victims’ pension and seek to expedite the application process; continue to direct substantial funding to the Victims and Survivors Service and work of Veterans Commissioner; pursue a UK-wide definition of a victim which rejects any equivalence between the perpetrator and the victim; resist attempts by republicans and elements of the media to justify terrorist campaigns; seek to prevent human rights legislation being exploited to rewrite the past; explore the potential to define collusion in legislation to address sweeping and call for a full investigation by the Irish Government into allegations of collusion between the Garda and the IRA; press for further progress by the Omagh Public Inquiry following the announcement of the Terms of Reference in February 2024; challenge the Irish Government to launch a public inquiry into the Omagh atrocity; ensure paramilitaries and organised crime gangs are pursued by all legal means and put out of business; seek to establish an oral and video archive for victims and survivors of the Troubles which incorporates the stories of first responders; increase transparency in out-of-court settlements agreed by the MoD and PSNI in legacy cases.
Crime and Policing The DUP believes that when it comes to tackling increasingly sophisticated and harmful forms of crime and breaking the cycle of harm and control exerted by criminal and paramilitary gangs, there can be no substitute for a fully staffed and properly resourced police service.
In Northern Ireland those efforts have not only been frustrated, but undermined, by a steady decline in policing budgets. In more than a decade, there has been a 3% growth in the policing and justice budget compared to 70% and 45% for health and education respectively, and the recruitment of tens of thousands of additional officers in England and Wales has not been replicated here.
The Treasury needs to accept that this is about more than how an Executive slices the cake – the cake simply is not big enough. The most visible symptom of this rising crisis is the loss of police officers. A recent independent review commissioned by the Chief Constable concluded that had police resources kept pace with England, Scotland and Wales in recent years the PSNI would presently have over 8,000 officers. Instead, we have 6,400. That is not a sustainable position for any public body, let alone an organisation tasked with investigating crime, fighting terrorism and keeping our communities safe. The outworking, of course, is slower response, a reduced neighbourhood presence and fewer detectives.
It is imperative that the next Government prioritises the safety of its citizens in all parts of the United Kingdom through a fiscal framework and funding model that is fair and meets the needs of police service, courts and wider criminal justice system.
DUP MPs will: press for uplifts in Government funding for Northern Ireland’s Additional Security needs and the Tackling Paramilitarism Programme; seek a statutory definition of Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE) to better target paramilitaries and crime gangs who prey on children and young people; seek to resist the further erosion of stop and search powers; campaign to strengthen the role of the National Crime Agency in NI; support national strategies to reduce high demand for police services that could and should be routinely dealt with by the health service; seek to protect neighbourhood policing resources; ensure the design of national police command courses reflect Northern Ireland’s policing requirements and encourage strong representation by PSNI officers; campaign to enhance resources for occupational health and wellbeing services within policing; support tough measures to address all forms of elder abuse, including financial crime.
Violence Against Women & Girls DUP MPs will: seek to address gaps in funding for specialist support for survivors of domestic abuse; support robust and up-to-date vetting in police forces across the UK; seek an improved response to trolling and other forms of technology-facilitated abuse against women online; promote a review of arrangements governing the disclosure of victims’ personal information in sexual and domestic abuse cases; call on the Government to review the ‘No Recourse to Public Funds’ (NRPF) for migrants who suffer domestic abuse and are at risk; seek a review by DWP of the requirement for those experiencing domestic abuse to apply for split payments of certain benefits.
Justice and the Courts DUP MPs will support: establishing a Royal Commission into the effectiveness of the criminal justice system across the UK; pressing for stronger custodial sentences for murder and terror offences in NI, bringing NI into line with other regions; seeking to try terrorism cases faster, reducing the cost to our prison budgets from suspects spending months, even years, on remand; investing in community-based initiatives and diversionary programmes aimed at addressing the root causes of crime; increasing funding for speech and language and mental health support services within the criminal justice system, including prison service; promoting tougher sentencing for physical assaults on retail staff; reviewing how the criminal justice system deals with peer-on-peer and teenage relationship abuse.
