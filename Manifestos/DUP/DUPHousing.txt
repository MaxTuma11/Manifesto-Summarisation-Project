DUP MPs will:  fight to ensure national immigration and asylum policy applies equally across the United Kingdom by restoring Parliamentary sovereignty over the law in Northern Ireland;  support an approach that allows those fleeing war or persecution to find refuge in the United Kingdom, underpinned by: • renewed efforts to smash and deter crime gangs who profit from illegal and unsafe transports across the Channel; • a recognition that our neighbours and allies must do their fair share; • speedier and more efficient processes for dealing with asylum claims; • reviewing the impact of the Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contracts on housing need and public services in all UK regions.
There are clear synergies between the All-Island Rail Review and the Union Connectivity Review and the latter recommended that the Government provide funding and major project expertise for the purposes of delivering specific recommendations for cross-border rail. We will work with the Government to take forward this workstream in a way that promotes growth, jobs, housing and social cohesion for communities in Northern Ireland and right across the UK.
