 Our plan for a secure, dynamic and growing economy.
In 2010 we inherited an economy in tatters, with Labour admitting themselves there was ‘no money’. We have faced three generational global economic challenges: the aftermath of the fnancial crisis; a global pandemic; and the biggest energy shock since the 1970s.
Against this backdrop, since 2010 the UK has had the third highest growth rate in the G7.
We have created four million more jobs, cut taxes for working people and pensioners and repaired the public fnances. The UK economy is now growing faster than Germany, France, Italy and the United States, real wages have been rising for nearly a year, infation has fallen from 11.1% to 2.3%, lower than in Europe and the US, and debt as a share of GDP is forecast to start falling next year. The plan we set out last year, to halve infation, grow the economy and reduce debt, is working.
Economic security is the bedrock of any future success, which is why we have a clear plan to take the bold action needed to build a strong economy.
❱ reducing borrowing and debt; ❱ backing businesses to invest, innovate and trade; ❱ cutting taxes and reforming our welfare system; ❱ delivering world-class education; and ❱ delivering an afordable transition to domestic, sustainable energy.
Reducing debt and borrowing Sustainable public fnances are essential for a strong economic plan. It was only because of the difcult decisions we took to repair the public fnances after 2010, which saw the defcit fall from 10.3% under Labour to 2.1% on the eve of the pandemic, that we were able to provide almost £400 billion of support to families and businesses to get through Covid and the energy shock.
The only way to give people the peace of mind that government will be able to support them again when future shocks hit is to get borrowing and debt down. The alternative is to let borrowing get out of control, driving infation and interest rates up, and leaving our children and grandchildren to pick up the bill.
In the next Parliament, we will continue to meet our fscal rules of having public sector net debt falling and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3% of GDP in the ffth year of the forecast. The measures in this manifesto are fully funded and would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30, which will be the target year for our fscal rules in the frst fscal event of the new Parliament.
Backing business to invest, innovate and trade A competitive tax system.
The Conservative Party will always be the party of business. It is the private sector which will unlock the investment, growth and opportunities of the future.
That is why a tax system that incentivises business to invest is at the heart of our economic plan. We introduced the biggest business tax cut in modern British history, which hundreds of business leaders have described as the ‘single most transformational’ measure for growth and investment. So more businesses can beneft, we will look to extend our ‘full expensing’ policy to leasing, once the fscal conditions allow. And we will not raise corporation tax. For the very smallest businesses, the four million people who are self-employed, we will abolish the main rate of National Insurance entirely by the end of the next Parliament. We will back the risk takers and entrepreneurs who help drive our economy.
Small and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and we are making the UK the best place in the world to start or grow a business. We have great foundations: world-class talent, an internationally envied legal system and a business-friendly regulatory environment.
We are supporting frms with a business rates support package worth £4.3 billion over the next fve years to support small businesses and the high street. We want small businesses to get a bigger share of public contracts and have improved the public sector procurement system to that end. We have made it easier and cheaper for small businesses to hire an apprentice. And we have taken 28,000 small businesses out of paying VAT altogether by raising the VAT registration threshold to £90,000. In the next Parliament, we will deliver a ten point plan to support SMEs: 1� Continue to ease the burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality businesses by increasing the multiplier on distribution warehouses that support online shopping over time.
2� Keep the VAT threshold under review and explore options to smooth the clif edge at £90,000.
3� Improve access to fnance for SMEs including through expanding Open Finance and by exploring the creation of Regional Mutual Banks.
4� Take more companies out of the scope of burdensome reporting requirements� Making use of freedoms granted by Brexit, we will lift the employee threshold allowing more companies to be considered medium-sized. This is expected to save small businesses at least one million hours of admin per year.
5� Retain key tax incentives that encourage small businesses to grow, including the Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, Venture Capital Trusts, Business Asset Disposal Relief, Agricultural Property Relief and Business Relief. We will not increase Capital Gains Tax.
6� Promote digital invoicing and improve enforcement of the Prompt Payment Code to support small businesses with the perennial challenge of cashfow, building on our creation of the Small Business Commissioner with powers to tackle unfavourable payment practices.
7� Ensure that Basel III capital requirements do not inhibit lending to SMEs� 8� Continue our world leading programmes including the Invest in Women Task Force and the Lilac Review to encourage more female and disabled entrepreneurs.
9� Work with the British Business Bank and private sector fund managers to secure a £250 million Invest In Women Fund to support female entrepreneurs.
10� Work with public sector organisations including local authorities and NHS trusts and companies beneftting from government contracts to ensure that procurement opportunities are focused on SMEs in their local economies where possible and practical� Investing in infrastructure A Conservative Government will continue to invest in the digital, transport and energy infrastructure needed for businesses to grow.
Cutting tax for working people.
In the frst half of this year, we began cutting National Insurance. It is unfair that working people pay two taxes on their income – income tax and National Insurance – when other people only pay income tax.
Our long-term ambition, when it is afordable to do so, is to keep cutting National Insurance until it’s gone, as part of our plan to make the tax system simpler and fairer. As the next step in that plan, we will cut employee National Insurance to 6% by April 2027 – meaning that we will have halved it from 12% at the beginning of this year, a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000.
This comes on top of the signifcant above infation increase to the personal allowance we have delivered since 2010, nearly doubling it from £6,475 to £12,750.
This means the tax burden on workers is falling, with the average earner paying the lowest efective personal tax rate since 1975 – lower than in the US, France, Germany or any G7 country.
As a further downpayment on our long-term ambition to abolish National Insurance, there is one group for whom we will make that a reality in the next Parliament. Last year, the main rate of National Insurance for the self-employed stood at 9%. To recognise the unique contribution of these risk-takers and entrepreneurs to our economy and the insecurity they face without the rights and protections that employees enjoy, we will abolish it entirely by the end of the next Parliament. The abolition of the main rate of Class 4 National Insurance contributions builds on our abolition of Class 2 contributions for self-employed people from April this year. This will not afect their entitlement to the State Pension. This is a massive simplifcation of the tax system which means that 93% of self-employed people – four million of them – will no longer pay self- employed National Insurance.
As well as cutting National Insurance for 29 million people, we will also not raise the rate of income tax or VAT.
Increasing pay for working people.
We introduced the National Living Wage in 2016 and this year achieved our ambition of raising it to two thirds of median earnings – increasing it to £11.44 per hour and extending it to cover all workers aged over 21. This ended low pay for those on the National Living Wage, with someone working full-time receiving a pay rise worth £1,800. As a result of our personal tax cuts and increases in the minimum wage, the take-home pay of someone working full  time on the National Living Wage has gone up by 35% in real terms since 2010.
We will maintain the National Living Wage in each year of the next Parliament at two-thirds of median earnings. On current forecasts, that would mean it rising to around £13 per hour, up from a minimum wage of £5.80 under Labour in 2010.
We will ensure the UK retains the fexible and dynamic labour market that gives businesses the confdence to create jobs and invest in their workforce. The number of payrolled employees is at a near record high, and there are around four million more people in work than when we came to ofce in 2010.
Cutting tax for pensioners We believe that those who have worked hard during their lives should have dignity and security in their retirement. We came to power in 2010 after Labour had hit pensioners with a £118 billion pensions tax raid and a paltry 75p per week increase to the State Pension.
Since 2010, we have made it a priority to give people peace of mind in their retirement. We introduced the Triple Lock, which has seen the basic State Pension rise by £3,700 since 2010.
This year, the new State Pension increased by £900.
We will continue to do everything we can to provide pensioners with dignity in retirement and ensure the new State Pension is not dragged into income tax for the frst time in history by introducing the new Triple Lock Plus. This has two elements: 1. Continuing to uprate the State Pension in line with the highest of prices, earnings or 2.5%. On current forecasts, this will mean the new State Pension increases by a further £430 in April next year to £11,970; and increases by £1,685 a year to £13,200 by the end of the Parliament.
2. Ensuring that from next year the tax- free personal allowance for pensioners also rises by the highest of prices, earnings or 2.5%, guaranteeing that the new State Pension is always below the tax-free threshold. From April 2025, we will increase the personal allowance for pensioners by introducing a new age-related personal allowance. This is a tax cut of around £100 for eight million pensioners next year – rising to £275 a year by the end of the Parliament.
Under our new Pensions Tax Guarantee, the Conservatives will not introduce any new taxes on pensions. We will maintain the 25% tax free lump sum and maintain tax relief on pension contributions at their marginal rate. We will not extend National Insurance to employer pension contributions.
We will maintain all current pensioner benefts, including free bus passes, Winter Fuel Payments, free prescriptions and TV licences.
We are carefully considering the Ombudsman report into WASPI women and will work with Parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response.
By opposing the Triple Lock Plus, Labour’s Retirement Tax will mean millions of pensioners paying more tax. It will also mean that for the frst time in history, someone whose only income is the new State Pension will be dragged into paying income tax, which alongside making them worse of means the administrative burden of going through a tax assessment.
