Buses.
Urban bus services have dropped by 48% and rural buses by 52% since 2008. Yet they are vital to our communities. Every £1 invested in bus services is estimated to bring an economic return of £4.50.
Elected Greens would push for local authority control and proper funding for bus services, to increase these in urban areas, and in rural areas ensure that there is a bus service to every village.
We will empower local authorities to run bus services themselves if they see fit and provide a service that meets their community’s needs.
Cities and sparsely populated rural areas will need different solutions; we need to give them the flexibility and funding.
Rail.
Privatisation of the railways has failed – we have all experienced the decline in the standard of services, strikes and growing dissatisfaction. The railways should be the backbone of a sustainable transport system. Elected Greens will push for: • Investment in a modern, efficient, publicly owned railway, with affordable fares.
• Greater investment in more rapid electrification so the rail network can be powered sustainably.
• A national strategic approach to identifying those lines and stations which could be re-opened. This should be led by regional and local government to ensure the most benefits.

Roads.
To address the huge and growing contribution that private-vehicle transport makes to our carbon emissions, it’s time to shift the transport system away from cars and roads.
Green MPs will push to restore the fuel-duty escalator to this end and, as revenue declines, we favour the introduction of road-pricing, designed to ensure the protection of users’ privacy. Greens will oppose all new road building plans.
Within a decade we want to see all petrol and diesel vehicles replaced by Electric Vehicles (EVs).
We would push for an extensive vehicle scrappage scheme to support this rapid transition to EVs, with funding rising to £5bn per year by the end of the parliament, supported by the rapid rollout of EV charging points.
EVs have a place in our future transport system but even a wholesale switch would still not deliver on our ambitious plan to make our roads safer and greener.
Elected Greens would therefore also push for: • An end to sales of new petrol and diesel fuelled vehicles by 2027 and to the use of petrol and diesel vehicles on the road by 2035.
• Making road tax proportional to vehicle weight.
• 20 miles per hour to be the default speed limit on roads in all built-up areas, allowing children, the elderly and disabled people to walk and wheel safely.
• More government support for ordinary car users and small businesses to replace their vehicles as diesel and petrol engines are phased out.
• More support for firms using heavy goods vehicles to transition away from internal combustion engines and make greater use of rail freight.
Safe streets and active travel Walking and cycling aren’t just good for reducing carbon emissions and air pollution – they help make us all happier and healthier.
Elected Greens will: • Push to spend £2.5bn a year on new cycleways and footpaths, built using sustainable materials.
• Reimagine how we use streets in residential areas to reduce traffic and open them up for use by the community.
• Adopt Active Travel England’s objective for 50% of trips in England’s towns and cities to be walked, wheeled or cycled by 2030.
Aviation.
Aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of global carbon emissions – and it’s the wealthiest driving this trend. The wealthiest people in the UK use more energy flying than the poorest use in every aspect of their lives. Just 1% of the world’s population accounts for more than half of the CO2 emissions from passenger air travel. We need to reduce how much we fly, and we need to do it fairly.
Green MPs will campaign for: • A frequent-flyer levy to reduce the impact of the 15% of people who take 70% of flights.
• A ban on domestic flights for a journey that would take less than three hours by train.
• An end to the implicit subsidy for flying that results from kerosene being exempt from fuel duty: the carbon tax would apply to all kerosene for aviation sold in the UK • A halt to any expansion of airport capacity.
• Investment in skills so that aviation and airport workers can move into rewarding alternative jobs as the number of flights declines.
(In Wales, transport is devolved to the Welsh Government.)
