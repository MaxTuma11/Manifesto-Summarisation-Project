Health.
Good health gives people the freedom to live their lives as they choose. A thriving economy needs a healthy population. Universal high-quality healthcare, free at the point of use and accessible wherever and whenever it’s needed, is therefore essential for both individual freedom and national prosperity.
Our NHS used to be the envy of the world. But now, too many people can’t access the care they need. The Conservatives have plunged the NHS into crisis – as have the SNP in Scotland and Labour in Wales. With more than a hundred thousand staff vacancies in England alone, a crisis in staff retention, long waiting times, missed targets and poor outcomes, patient safety is being pushed into the danger zone.
Getting an appointment with a GP can take weeks and seeing an NHS dentist is almost impossible. People are no longer confident that when they ring 999 an ambulance will turn up in time. Millions are waiting for treatment, unable to work.
The frontline workers who were rightly applauded are now overworked and burnt out.
Liberal Democrats believe that people should be in control of their own lives and health and that means everyone should get the care they need, when they need it, where they need it. Instead of just spending money firefighting crisis after crisis, we will invest now to save taxpayers’ money in the long-run. We will strengthen patients’ rights, fix crumbling hospitals, recruit and retain a workforce for the future, invest in technology that improves outcomes and saves money, and restore the UK as a world leader in health research.
Our plan will tackle the crisis at both the front door and the back door to the NHS: investing in public health and early access to community services, including GPs, pharmacists and dentists, so fewer people need to go to hospital in the first place, and fixing the crisis in social care to stop so many people being stuck in hospital beds. Liberal Democrats understand that we need to fix social care to save our NHS.

Care.
Everyone deserves high-quality care when they need it. Liberal Democrats want everyone to be able to live independently and with dignity, and receive any care they need in their own home wherever possible.
Carers – paid and unpaid, young and old – do a remarkable and important job.
They deserve far more support, but are too often forgotten and ignored.
But social care services in this country are in crisis. Hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for care. Many are stranded in hospital beds because the care isn’t in place for them to leave, putting even more strain on the NHS.
The Conservatives promised to “fix” the crisis in our social care system, that no one would have to sell their house to pay for personal care costs, and that they would not raise taxes to do it. They have broken all these promises.
We will empower care users, and support care workers and the millions of unpaid carers looking after loved ones. We will forge a new consensus on funding to ensure that no one has to sell their home to pay for their personal care. We will invest to save, recognising that providing care reduces demand on more expensive NHS services.
We will: • Introduce free personal care based on the model introduced by the Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland in 2002, so that provision is based on need, not ability to pay.
• Create a social care workforce plan, establish a Royal College of Care Workers to improve recognition and career progression, and introduce a higher Carer’s Minimum Wage.
• Establish a cross-party commission to forge a long-term agreement on sustainable funding for social care.
• Give unpaid carers a fair deal so they get the support they so desperately need, including paid carer’s leave and a statutory guarantee of regular respite breaks.
• Develop a digital strategy to enable care users to live tech-enabled lives.
In addition, we will: • Provide truly personalised care that empowers individuals by: • Trialling personal health and social care budgets so that individuals are in control of what care they receive.
• Rolling out digital platforms for care users to develop networks, relationships and opportunities, connecting with care workers, friends and family, voluntary groups and more.
• Improving communication standards so carers can support care users to co-produce and monitor care plans.
• Developing a digital strategy for tech-enabled lives.
• Establishing an Independent Living Taskforce to help people live independently in their own homes, as set out in chapter 10.
• End the postcode lottery of service provision and provide national, high-quality care for everyone who needs it by: • Providing predictable, consistent funding for free personal care.
• Increasing transparency and accountability as to how money is spent through local authorities.
• Creating a National Care Agency to set national minimum standards of care.
• Enabling individuals to transfer their care package so they don’t feel stuck in their current locality due to their care needs.
• Give unpaid carers a fair deal by: • Increasing Carer’s Allowance and expanding eligibility for it, as set out in chapter 10.
• Introducing a statutory guarantee of regular respite breaks for unpaid carers.
• Introducing paid carer’s leave, building on the entitlement to unpaid leave secured by the Liberal Democrats.
• Making caring a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 and requiring employers to make reasonable adjustments to enable employees with caring responsibilities to provide that care.
• Introducing a Young Carers Pupil Premium as part of an ‘Education Guarantee’ for young carers.
• Make careers in social care more attractive and value experienced staff to improve retention by: • Creating a new Carer’s Minimum Wage, boosting the minimum wage for care workers by £2 an hour, as a starting point for improved pay across the sector.
• Creating clear career pathways, linked to recommended pay scales, which put an end to the undervaluing of skills in the sector.
• Creating a career ladder to allow flexibility to work across the NHS and social care, allowing staff to gain experience in both.
• Creating a Royal College of Care Workers to represent this skilled workforce.
• Expanding the NHS Digital Staff Passport to include the care sector.
