    "Alliance": "UK public finances are in a difficult space – Public Sector Net Debt is at a level last seen in the early 1960s. This is after over a decade of damaging austerity initiated by the UK Government to address the post-2008 financial bailout and associated debt overhang. The Truss/Kwarteng Mini Budget compounded the situation by undermining trust and credibility in the UK government. Alliance believes reforming the Fiscal Rules could unlock significant investment. This could be funded via long-term bond issuance in addition to existing UK Green Gilts. Without such reform, UK fiscal policy is reinforcing relative climate inaction and storing up environmental, social and financial crises for the future. Alliance believes there is a credible case for increasing the total quantum of funding available to the UK Government for strategic expenditure via a revised fiscal framework. Two other core components of the net funding envelope, namely taxation and welfare support, are determined by UK Government Fiscal Policy. Loopholes in the tax system accommodate significant tax avoidance for the super- wealthy. We believe there is scope for a shift in taxation related to environmental protection, including carbon taxes. The current levels of state pension provisions in the UK are relatively low by European standards. Alliance believes auto-enrolment in workplace pensions is a key tool in ensuring people have a dignified retirement. We support a compensation system adjusted to reflect the extent of the change in the individual’s State Pension age and how much notice they received. Alliance supports the delivery of a Carer’s Allowance Supplement. We also support increases in support for maternity, paternity, shared-parental and adoption entitlements. Northern Ireland is currently suffering from a super-disparity in childcare support. Fundamentally, the core level of funding for NI is key for our economic, social and financial wellbeing. The Fiscal Council suggests that we have been structurally underfunded by between £300–£400m per year since 2022 versus the level we would receive if an appropriate Fiscal Floor were in place. Alliance believes that a Fiscal Floor of 124 does not reflect our relative need in NI versus England. Maximising Shared Island Funding Alliance will explore with the Irish Government how this fund can be increased and deployed to further projects in a wider range of areas. We believe Northern Ireland can become the most innovative and dynamic regional economy in Europe. • Continue development of broadband, high-speed mobile internet access and similar telecommunications projects in a manner that ensures all parts of the UK benefit from this technology. Establish a UK Export Fund for SMEs, to enable enhanced export orientation. • Create a legal duty on the UK Government to ensure its economic policies are assessed on their likelihood. Alliance will support a general review of the Apprenticeship Levy across the UK, and ensure that any levy raised from Northern Ireland is ring-fenced for re-investment in skills. Northern Ireland currently receives the lowest share per capita in the United Kingdom of defence contracts. Alliance will continue to lobby the Ministry of Defence to ensure that Northern Ireland-based companies have proper opportunities to compete for contracts and that the local SME sector can access related opportunities.",
    "Conservative": "Cut tax for workers by taking another 2p of employee National Insurance so we will have halved it from 12% at the beginning of this year to 6% by April 2027, a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000.  Cut taxes to support the self-employed by abolishing the main rate of Self-employed National Insurance entirely by the end of the Parliament.  Increase NHS spending above infation every year, recruiting 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors, driving up productivity in the NHS and moving care closer to people’s homes.  Deliver 1.6 million well-designed homes in the right places while protecting our countryside, permanently abolish Stamp Duty for homes up to £425,000 for frst time buyers. The plan we set out last year, to halve infation, grow the economy and reduce debt, is working. Economic security is the bedrock of any future success, which is why we have a clear plan to take the bold action needed to build a strong economy. Reducing debt and borrowing Sustainable public fnances are essential for strong economic plan. We are supporting frms with a business rates support package worth £4.3 billion over the next fve years to support small businesses and the high street. We want small businesses to get a bigger share of public contracts and have improved the public sector procurement system to that end. We have taken 28,000 small businesses out of paying VAT altogether by raising the VAT registration threshold to £90,000. In the next Parliament, we will deliver a ten point plan to support SMEs. In the frst half of this year, we began cutting National Insurance. It is unfair that working people pay two taxes on their income – income tax and national Insurance – when other people only pay income tax. Our long-term ambition is to keep cutting national Insurance until it’s gone, as part of our plan to make the tax system simpler and fairer. As part of that plan, we will have cut employee National Insurance to 6% by April 2027 – meaning that we will halve it from 12% We introduced the National Living Wage in 2016 and this year achieved our ambition of raising it to £11.44 per hour and extending it to cover all workers aged over 21. As a result of our personal tax cuts and increases in the minimum wage, the take-home pay of someone working full-time has gone up by 35% in real terms since 2010. The number of payrolled employees is at a near record high, and there are around four million more people in work than when we came to ofce in 2010. Cutting tax for Under our new Pensions Tax Guarantee, the Conservatives will not introduce any new taxes on pensions. We will maintain the 25% tax free lump sum and maintain tax relief on pension contributions at their marginal rate.",
    "DUP": "The DUP believes underfunding has destroyed Northern Ireland’s capacity to provide frontline services that are fit for the 21st century. Northern Ireland has the highest proportion of public sector workers in the United Kingdom. Only Scotland’s population is more dispersed. Yet when it comes to distributing money under the Barnett Formula, Northern Ireland receives less than it needs to match public services in England. Pursuing greater access for women seeking surgery for endometriosis. Campaigning on rare diseases and ensuring Cystic Fibrosis sufferers have access to wonder drug Orkambi. We have recognised the need to end disparities between arrangements benefiting health staff working in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. DUP MPs will engage in discussions with the UK Government about public sector pay across the UK. The DUP values the work and contribution of our dedicated civil servants. The Northern Ireland Civil Service is different to its counterparts in Scotland and Wales. DUP MPs will campaign to: 3 oppose the freeze on personal tax allowance and higher rate income tax threshold; 3 seek further reductions in national insurance, building on consecutive cuts in the last Parliament. 3 support an increase in the starting age for employee national insurance; 3 support the uprating of benefits in line with inflation; 3 continue to support rises to the national living wage. Paul Givan MLA has announced a new package of measures worth £25 million. They are supporting the need for flexible childcare work policies. If elected, they will: 3 work with employers and HMRC to incentivise the Workplace Nursery Model in NI. DUP MPs will campaign to: 3 deliver increased economic and educational opportunities for young people by building relationships across the United Kingdom. 3 reduce disparities in support between under-20s who undertake apprenticeships and those in this age group who remain in school or education. DUP MPs will campaign to: 3 increase the VAT threshold for SMEs to £100,000. 3 drive up the number of SMEs benefiting from government procurement spend, tax reliefs and business support; 3 protect cash flow. The Employment Allowance should be uprated in line with increases to the national living wage. Progress has been achieved in this with Invest NI’s global footprint expanded with the support of UK Government funding and more trade advisers recruited. We want to see the next Government go even further. In particular, we will: 3 support the development a new UK export strategy with a specific trade plan for NI. 3 seek government funding to expand NI's trade presence across the world, including through recruitment of more staff. DUP MPs will: 3 support the establishment of an Independent UK Skills Commission. This body would be tasked with assessing our current and future labour needs. The DUP remains committed to replacing the Apprenticeship Levy with a new system. DUP MPs will seek: 3 review of the structure and operation of the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) This should include consideration of formal representation from the devolved regions and how a reformed MAC could work in partnership with a new Independent Skills Commission to map and meet labour shortages across the UK. The current threshold is £38,700, well above the average salary in NI; 3 to ensure fair minimum salary thresholds for skilled overseas workers. Northern Ireland’s first banking hub has been established in Kilkeel. It is a shared service that operates in a similar way to a standard branch. The DUP will: 3 work with banks to establish more banking hubs on our high streets and town centres. There should be a substantive notice period before accounts can be closed. The DUP believes there are a number of fundamental issues that require resolution with the Treasury before the powers to vary corporation tax rates can be enacted. This means ensuring a process of implementation that protects spending on public services in the short to medium-term. The Democratic Unionist Party believes that now more than ever there is a need to strengthen the United Kingdom’s defence industrial base and grow our Armed Forces.",
    "Green": "Green MPs would work to make this industry a force for good. Any company holding a UK banking licence will be required to present an investment strategy outlining a clear pathway to divestment of its current fossil fuel assets. The Bank of England’s mandate will be changed so that funding the sustainability transition becomes a central objective, alongside the maintenance of price stability. There will be credit bans/ceilings for unsustainable activities. We want to change markets where customers, suppliers and workers are open to exploitation through market dominance. We also want to ensure that structures exist in markets that allow for a competitively fair transition to a zero-carbon economy. It is not acceptable that large companies or public bodies rely on unarranged credit from smaller enterprises to manage their cash flow. Elected Greens will campaign to bring the Prompt Payment Code into law and bar late payers from public-procurement contracts. Elected Greens will campaign to amend Companies Act 2006. The Green Party believes that workers’ and trade union rights need to be restored after decades of decline under successive governments. Too many people are being exploited and underpaid, with too little protection from the law. We will require all large and medium-sized companies to carry out equal pay audits and redress any inequality uncovered. We will campaign for safe sick pay because it’s good for workers, good for employers and good for public health. Every worker deserves equal protection, with full and equal rights from the first day of employment. Elected Greens will take every opportunity to advocate for the most disadvantaged in society. This major change to our tax and social security system is the work of more than one parliament. In the meantime, we will end benefit sanctions and challenge the punitive approach to welfare claimants. Elected Greens will push too for the reform Capital Gains Tax (CGT) by aligning the rates paid by taxpayers on income and taxable gains. This would affect less than 2% of all income-tax payers. We would remove the Upper Earnings Limit that restricts National Insurance paid by high earners. Greens will advocate for a carbon tax to incentivise businesses to decarbonise supply chains and to help raise the money needed to shift to zero-carbon economy. The changes would raise up to an additional £40bn in business taxes during the five years of the next parliament.",
    "Labour": "Every commitment a Labour government makes will be based on sound money and economic stability. We reject this flawed ideology that was tested to destruction by the disastrous Conservative ‘mini budget’. The Conservatives’ recklessness sent a signal of instability across the world. We will reduce food prices by removing barriers to businesses trading. We will make housing more affordable, expand access to childcare, and make work pay. The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. Labour will bring stability, good jobs and higher living standards. It is Labour’s first mission for government. It means being pro-business and pro-worker. This election follows the chaos of the Conservatives’ ‘mini-budget’. We will use public investment where it can unlock additional private sector investment, create jobs, and provide a return for taxpayers. Britain is hampered by a planning regime that means we struggle to build either the infrastructure or housing the country needs. The country remains too centralised, with the economic potential of too many regions and communities ignored. We will work in partnership with industry to seize opportunities and remove barriers to growth. To realise these opportunities Labour will establish a National Wealth Fund. Capitalised with £7.3 billion over the course of the next Parliament. The fund will have a target of attracting three pounds of private investment for every one pound of public investment, creating jobs across the country. Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays, cost overruns, uncertainty for supply chains, and our infrastructure crumbling. The current planning regime acts as a major brake on economic growth. Labour will make the changes we need to forge ahead with new roads, railways, reservoirs, and other nationally significant infrastructure. Labour will stop the chaos and turn the page to create a partnership between business and trade unions by implementing ‘Labour’s Plan to Make Work Pay: Delivering a New Deal for Working People’ in full. We will consult fully with businesses, workers, and civil society on how to put our plans into practice before legislation is passed. This will include banning exploitative zero hours contracts; ending fire and rehire; and introducing basic rights from day one to parental leave, sick pay, and protection from unfair dismiss",
    "LibDem": "Liberal Democrats will build a strong, fair economy that benefits everyone in the UK. Core to our economic policy for improving stability and growth will be responsible management of the public finances, fixing the broken trading relationship with Europe, and an industrial strategy focused on the skills the future UK economy will need. Conservatives have badly mismanaged the economy, grinding economic growth to a halt and adding billions to the cost of servicing our debt. Implement a tax policy that recognises how high the Conservatives have raised personal taxes, making the cost-of-living crisis worse. Instead focusing tax changes on reversing the Conservative tax cuts for big banks and imposing a proper, one-off windfall tax on the super-profits of oil and gas producers and traders. • Launching an ambitious industrial strategy to incentivise businesses to invest and create good jobs across the UK. Expand the British Business Bank to perform a more central role in the economy. Empower consumers and ensure everyone can enjoy the benefits of new technology. Introduce a national financial inclusion strategy and require both the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority to have regard to financial inclusion. We will: • Develop an industrial strategy that will give businesses certainty and incentivise them to invest in new technologies to grow the economy, create good jobs and tackle the climate crisis. Fix the skills and recruitment crisis by investing in education and training, including increasing the availability of apprenticeships and career advice for young people. • Boost small businesses and empower them to create new local jobs. Ensures the use of personal data and AI is unbiased, transparent and accurate, and respects the privacy of innocent people. Negotiate UK’s participation in the Trade and Technology Council with the US and the EU. • Creating new Lifelong Skills Grants for adults to spend on education and training throughout their lives, as set out in chapter 8. Identifying and seeking to solve skills gaps, such as lack of advanced technicians, by expanding higher vocational training like foundation degrees, Higher National Diplomas and Higher Apprenticeships. Fix the work visa system and expand the Youth Mobility Scheme. • Supporting small employers with Statutory Sick Pay costs, consulting with them on",
    "PlaidCymru": "We are living with the legacies of all these examples of the Conservatives’ poor economic judgement, which are being echoed by a Labour Party that has already tied itself to their spending plans. Our public services are underfunded and have been hollowed out, and our economy has stagnated. We want to see a new needs-based funding formula introduced in place of the Barnett Formula. Plaid Cymru would equalise capital gains tax with income tax. We would investigate increasing higher earners’ National Insurance contributions. We would crack down on tax evasion and avoidance. A Development Agency for Wales We will establish a Just Transition Commission. This means a forward-thinking approach that will meet economic challenges into the 2050s and beyond. We recognise the importance of accessing capital and will reform the Development Bank of Wales. Our aim will be for the bank to take and profit from greater equity shares in emerging businesses. Fairness for Employees. We support the devolution of employment law to Wales. In a world of increasing threats to workers, employment rights desperately need strengthening. We would also support legislation to tackle insecure work.",
    "Reform": "Reform UK will back risk takers and wealth creators. Save £5 in every £100 Every department must slash wasteful spending, cut bureaucracy, improve efficiency and negotiate better value procurement without touching frontline services. Cut Unnecessary Regulations Britain still retains over 6,700 EU laws. Lift the Income Tax Start Point to £20,000 Per Year This frees up to 7 million people from paying Income Tax and saves every worker almost £1,500 per year. Basic Tax rate stays at 20%. The higher rate should begin at £70,000. Cut Energy Taxes, Beat the Cost-of-Living Crisis Save households over £500 per Year. Lower fuel duty by 20p per litre for both residential and business users. Scrap VAT on energy bills. Scrap environmental levies. Abolish VAT Tourist Tax The government Support Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Abolish Business Rates for high street based SMEs. Offset this with Online Delivery Tax at 4% for large, multinational enterprises. Cut entrepreneurs’ tax to 5%. Reform the Planning System Fast-track new housing on brownfield sites and infrastructure projects to boost businesses.",
    "SDLP": "SDLP MPs will work to build a prosperous, world-leading and regionally equitable economy that works for everyone no matter background, circumstance or geography. The SDLP supports the creation of a strategy that is tailored to the sectors that have most to gain from the Protocol/Windsor Framework. SDLP representatives opposed the decision to hand over welfare powers to the British government. We have seen the consequences of that decision play out in communities across Northern Ireland in recent years. The SDLP placed poverty at the top of the agenda at Stormont by devoting an entire Opposition Day to the subject. Arts and culture in Northern Ireland is underfunded, with arts spending per head dramatically lower than any other part of these islands. We support a meaningful increase to arts funding to catch up with other jurisdictions on these islands the delivery of a new Arts, Culture and Heritage Strategy without delay. The SDLP is committed to defending education at all levels as a public good and fully supports properly funding higher and further education to expand opportunities for all people, regardless of backgrounds. Working alongside the SDLP Opposition at Stormont, SDLP MPs will fight for: 1. A full-size university at Magee of at least 10,000 students Achieving a full-sized university in Derry is a critical lever to drive economic development in the region. We also secured millions of pounds of investment from the Irish government through the Share A New Approach to Further & Higher Education We support a new approach to third level education that creates a skills pipeline from schools to colleges and universities. Further education colleges must be supported in tandem with universities to ensure a coherent skills ecosystem. The Department for the Economy must progress the reform of Further Education delivery. SDLP believes in breaking down every barrier to participation in the economy. We must ensure the implementation of legislation on gender pay gap reporting. In addition, we support reform of the full rate equivalent maternity leave which is currently one of the lowest across OECD countries.",
    "SinnFein": "Sinn Féin has been central to the fightback against the negative, cuts-driven and destructive policies of the Tories. We want to increase productivity and opportunities for skills and training, regional balance in investment and job opportunities, accessible and affordable childcare and meet climate change targets through a fair and just transition to net zero. We will continue to offer strong leadership to all our people and communities with a commitment to work together with everyone to deliver",
    "SNP": "Scotland is an energy-rich nation but without full powers of independence we cannot fully harness the opportunities our vast renewable energy sources provide. We will demand the devolution of powers over energy regulation, pricing and production to ensure that our natural energy resources are used to best serve the needs of the Scottish people. Scotland as a whole should see far more of that benefit, but local communities who house the infrastructure – like pylons and wind farms – should get a much greater degree of benefit. SNP MPs will demand the full devolution of tax powers to enable us to create a fairer system that protects public services and invests in our economy. With the Devolution of National Insurance, we could ensure rates and thresholds fit our progressive income tax rates. We believe it is only right that companies making excess profits shoulder the burden that families face. The SNP is calling on the UK Government to scrap their fiscal rules and introduce new ones to allow greater investment in renewing infrastructure and services. The UK Government must abandon the current trajectory and recognise the value of investing in national infrastructure. Fiscal Rules We’re proposing a sensible alternative, setting out three new fiscal rules.",
    "TUV": "Reform UK will make work pay and help the unemployed to escape benefits trap. Lift Income Tax Start Point to £20,000 per Year.

Offset this with Online Delivery Tax at 4% for large, multinational enterprises. Cut entrepreneurs’ tax to 5%. Reform the Planning System Fast-track new housing on brownfield sites. Slash Red Tape to Boost Industry and Exports. Northern Ireland must not be left behind. The profligacy of Stormont must not rob our people of an objectively fair settlement.",
    "UUP": "The Ulster Unionist Party will work at Westminster to seek commitment to lower Leisure and Hospitality VAT in Northern Ireland to match the Republic of Ireland. We will lobby in Parliament to establish a 'Freeport Northern Ireland'. Ulster Unionists are committed to fiscal responsibility and effective financial stewardship. We aim to work with Westminster to gradually reduce Corporation Tax in Northern Ireland to 15%. By implementing necessary reforms and reducing Corporation Tax, we seek to enhance competitiveness, attract investment and drive economic growth throughout Northern Ireland. The 'triple lock' for pensions is a commitment made by the UK government to increase the state pension by the highest of three measures. This ensures that pensioners' incomes keep pace with rising cost of living and national prosperity. The Ulster Unionist Party recognises the vital importance of this policy in providing dignity and security for retirees."
